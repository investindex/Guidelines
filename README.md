# Guidelines for financial planning

There is no perfect distribution of stocks, long-term bonds, short-term bonds, cash, and other assets. This depends on many factors. Health, age, debt, income, job security, marriage status, children (or plans to have them), risk tolerance, and your personal goals — these are only some of them. The broad goal here is to provide tools to assess what investments fit your situation. However, a few guidelines can be applied broadly, and exploring them will help consider how to personalize your own finances.

&nbsp;

## Minimize risk of catastrophic loss

First, avoid extreme investment risks. Investing can be most hazardous when using debt or [leverage](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/leverage.asp): using [margin](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/margin.asp) features in a brokerage account or loans to invest in real estate, for instance. Leverage is not always dangerous, but it puts you at greater risk of large losses. It even creates the possibility of losing more than you invested, replacing what was once an asset with unexpected debt. Although I wouldn’t discourage all uses of leverage — a home mortgage is a form of leverage — none of the investment options recommended here use it.

Second, _always_ have insurance for extremely valuable physical assets like your car and home, as well as health insurance. Even if your car has low value, liability coverage is vital for car insurance. Without it, you could find yourself paying the medical bills of someone you injured in a car accident. Understand the coverage you’re entitled to, so that you’re not subject to surprise denials. Once you’ve achieved some financial stability, seriously consider purchasing disability insurance. Social Security disability payments are not enough to support you if you’re unable to continue earning income. And if anyone else depends on your future income, purchasing life insurance is a way to safeguard them. The most suitable type for almost everyone is [term life insurance](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/termlife.asp) (instead of [whole life insurance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AgBhy8iXjpI&ab_channel=TwoCents) or [universal life insurance](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/205.asp)). Finally, your most basic financial priority should be to build or maintain an [emergency fund](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vftjBTjFlzI&ab_channel=TwoCents) after paying off credit card debt.

Many people don’t take these actions or, if their finances are chronically strained, are unable to. But be aware that if you neglect to protect yourself, there will be an ever-present risk of financial ruin. Insurance may seem like a waste of money when times are good, but never forget that unpredictable, unavoidable events can shatter your life in an instant. Nothing can bankrupt you faster than expensive tragedies like a health crisis without health insurance.

&nbsp;

## Simplify, don't oversimplify

Index funds are useful because they invest in a shifting collection of hundreds or thousands of securities, which would be an onerous task for anyone without access to institutional resources. They illustrate that simple solutions can be superior to complex solutions. There are expanding offerings for the ultimate simplification: [one-decision funds](https://investor.vanguard.com/mutual-funds/lifestrategy). They allow you to select a single fund based on allocation, such as 60% stocks and 40% bonds, and provide you with an automatically [rebalanced](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/rebalancing.asp), globally diversified assembly of stocks and bonds. Although using one of these is far better than not investing, they carry a hazard.

When you decide how much money to save and invest, you should consider why you are investing: retirement, college tuition, a vacation, a down payment on a car or house. Assigning purposes to various portions of your money forces you to consider which investments are appropriate for each portion. One-decision funds, on the other hand, may cause someone to vaguely reflect on the level of risk they desire, without ever thinking through how they would distribute each portion to specific buckets like stocks, long-term bonds, and short-term bonds. Whatever degree of complexity you choose, ensure that your allocation is the result of deliberate planning.

&nbsp;

## Debt and investment

Pay debt instead of holding bonds or cash, and pay high-interest debt instead of holding stocks. Someone with low-interest loans — let’s say less than 4% [APY](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/apy.asp) — should not invest in bonds or hold large amounts of cash. This [usually includes someone](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKc01jo1qLw&ab_channel=BenFelix) with a home mortgage. Someone paying high interest — a 7% student loan or a 16% credit card loan — should not invest in the stock market either. A tax-free and risk-free 7% annualized return is achieved by every payment on a 7% APY loan. This is preferable to the higher average return from stocks, because the latter carries far more risk and will be taxed. Of course, you should address debt with the highest interest rate first; for many people this is credit card debt. All super high-interest loans like these should be paid off before investing or even building savings. Someone with a 4-5% APY loan should prioritize paying it, although they may want to hold some stocks as well. These groupings are somewhat arbitrary, but the underlying principle is that you should aim for the highest [risk-adjusted](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/riskadjustedreturn.asp) return after taxes.

&nbsp;

## Allocation and time horizon

People with higher net worth relative to their financial needs have longer time horizons, and benefit from allocating more heavily to stocks. This can be illustrated with an extreme case. A person with $4 million in liquid net worth could withdraw [about 2.5% each year](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BScK-QyWIo&ab_channel=BenFelix) — $100,000 in the first year before taxes — and live on these withdrawals indefinitely by holding a 100% stock portfolio. Not only would this person not deplete their assets, but because the withdrawals are conservative, the value of their investments would grow over the long run in virtually any plausible future stock market. Hopefully it is clear that for this person, seeking the supposed safety of bonds would encumber the long-term growth of their portfolio and make depletion of their assets _more_ likely.

For the majority of Americans who are not multimillionaires, how can this principle be applied? If there is a portion of your savings you are reserving for the future and don’t plan to use for a number of years,<sup id="fn1">[1](#f1)</sup> on average you will benefit most by investing it in 100% stocks. (This does not imply that your stock allocation should be limited to long-term reserves.) For many people this description applies readily to a tax-advantaged retirement account. If you will not need to draw on your retirement funds in the next eight years, your retirement portfolio will have the strongest expected growth with 100% stocks. Any inclusion of bonds will attenuate its long-term value. For some this statement will seem obvious, but it is a widespread practice to include bonds in long-term retirement portfolios. The justification often does not seem to be that part of the money needs to be secure for potential premature access, but that the volatility of a 100% stock portfolio is emotionally uncomfortable.

&nbsp;

## Tax-advantaged accounts

Most tax-advantaged retirement accounts are either an [IRA](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/ira.asp) (individual retirement account) or an employer-sponsored [401(k)](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/1/401kplan.asp). They incentivize retirement planning by offering the opportunity to save a great deal on taxes if you set aside the money until old age. With a traditional plan, no income tax is paid on contributions or earnings from investment, but withdrawals are taxed as ordinary income. With a Roth plan, contributions are taxed like the rest of your income, but earnings and [appropriate withdrawals](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/q/qualifieddistribution.asp) are tax-free.<sup id="fn2">[2](#f2)</sup> Withdrawals are meant to be delayed until age 59½, so early withdrawals are hit with a 10% penalty on top of triggering any tax owed, unless you meet [uncommon criteria](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/q/qualifieddistribution.asp). You should take advantage of employer matching every year in your IRA or 401(k) — even if you have high-interest debt. If there is a 50% matching policy, you will earn a risk-free, tax-deferred 50% return simply by contributing up to a certain limit. Even if you later need to withdraw the money prematurely with a 10% penalty, employer matching is not an opportunity you want to miss.

The only exception to this is if you plan to leave your company soon, and your matching contributions to a 401(k) [will not vest immediately](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/081815/can-my-company-ever-be-entitled-take-my-401k.asp). What does this mean? To incentize retention, your employer may require a certain period of working years until your matching contributions belong to you completely. That is, until you are 100% vested, some or all of your matching contributions may be revoked if you leave. Vesting may increase by 20 percentage points each year, for example, but the schedule is up to the employer except for the legal requirement that it must reach 100% after six years. Once you are 100% vested after six years at most, all prior and future matching contributions are immediately and permanently assured regardless of when you leave the company. Once you have maxed out employer matching, you can keep contributing up to a limit, or contribute to another tax-advantaged account like a [health savings account (HSA)](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/hsa.asp) or [529 account](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/1/529plan.asp).

These two additional account types provide tax advantages while allowing you to use the money for their designated purposes at any time — you don’t have to wait for old age. HSAs are especially helpful: contributions are tax-deductible up to a limit, investments grow tax-free, and withdrawals used for qualifying medical expenses are not taxed. You can reimburse yourself for previous medical expenses regardless of how long ago they were paid, as long as you can document the payments and the HSA was open when the expenses were incurred. Unlike your IRA or 401(k), your HSA even [escapes](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/09/18/this-triple-tax-advantaged-account-might-beat-your-401k-plan.html) FICA taxes, which fund Social Security and Medicare, as long as you contribute through your employer’s payroll deduction. For most people, FICA taxes amount to 7.65% of every dollar of income. Your employer may offer matching in your HSA because this enables them to pay you while escaping their share of FICA taxes. HSAs do have a drawback: if you desperately need the money and withdraw it for non-medical reasons before age 65, you’ll pay a penalty of 20% — twice as high as in retirement accounts — in addition to income taxes. From a retirement perspective, you can use your HSA purely as an investment vehicle. After age 65, you can use it for medical expenses as you would have before, but the 20% penalty if you withdraw for other reasons will be gone. The withdrawals for non-medical reasons will be subject to tax, but so would withdrawals from a traditional IRA or 401(k).

If you commit to [an investment approach](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/personal-finance/091615/how-use-your-hsa-retirement.asp), you should max out HSA contributions every year and refrain from spending any of your HSA funds before 65, so that they appreciate maximally. You would pay for medical expenses before 65 with your checking account, not your HSA. This is a little counterintuitive, but it would allow your untaxed HSA contributions to spiral upward with tax-free capital gains, and much of the money would be withdrawn tax-free as well. As you age during retirement, you will probably spend far more on medical expenses than when you were younger, and maximizing your HSA would mean you’re able to fund those large expenses with invested money that has never been taxed. Once you turn 65, you can no longer contribute to your HSA. If the investment approach were initiated early in life, you would contribute several hundred thousand dollars and have millions of dollars in the account by age 65. It is best used along with retirement accounts, which allow further tax-advantaged contributions each year and provide a source of last-resort funds that can be withdrawn with a lower 10% penalty. However, if your need for cash becomes dire and you’ve saved documentation of your medical expenses, you can withdraw HSA funds tax-free with no penalty by reimbursing yourself for past medical expenses, then use that money for whatever else. You could also use reimbursement as a means of tax-free withdrawal for normal expenses after 65, if your HSA funds exceed health needs.

Contributions to a 529 account are not tax-deductible at the federal level, but some states provide deductions under certain conditions. They are still beneficial because investments grow tax-free and appropriate withdrawals used for education are not taxed. But you need to research the investment options available to you before contributing. An IRA or HSA can offer almost as much freedom as a standard brokerage account,<sup id="fn3">[3](#f3)</sup> but the options for your 401(k) or 529 may be less attractive. This is why [rolling over](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/ira-rollover.asp) your 401(k) into your IRA when you change employers is generally a good idea. Unless your 401(k) allows “in-service” rollovers, you cannot roll over until you leave that employer.

Finally, if charitable donations will be an important goal in your old age, traditional IRAs have a clear advantage over Roth IRAs. The untaxed contributions and investment earnings in your traditional IRA can be [donated tax-free](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/ira-charitable-rollover-provision-made-permanent-2015-12-25), whereas money in your Roth IRA has already been taxed and is ideally suited for personal spending. However, your HSA should be an even higher priority in old age for charity, not because of its direct suitability but because it is [much less suited](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/what-are-the-rules-for-inheriting-an-hsa-2020-09-25) than a traditional IRA for inheritance by anyone except your spouse. That is, any non-spousal beneficiary would pay far more tax on inherited money from an HSA than from a traditional IRA.

&nbsp;

## Summary

Don’t ignore the possibility of catastrophic loss — protect yourself. Consider paying debt before investing. Money invested for the long term should be heavy on stocks. Use tax-advantaged accounts when you can, and consider exploiting the unique, under-appreciated advantages of HSAs. Max out employer matching even if you have debt, with awareness that if you change employers it is possible to lose some 401(k) matching due to your vesting schedule.

<sup id="f1"> 1 </sup> How many years exactly? A weasel word, _number_, is used because there is no perfect answer. The historical evidence suggests that a five-year horizon is sufficient in a large majority of cases, while an eight-year horizon is very safe and will permit you to wait for a recovery from nearly any potential downturn. In US history, only the Great Depression would violate this rule. [↩](#fn1)

<sup id="f2"> 2 </sup> The potential advantages of a traditional or Roth plan depend mainly on whether you expect your average tax rate to be higher during retirement or the year in which you’re contributing. A year with unusually low income suggests preferring the Roth plan, but someone with a large traditional IRA could also [convert some money to their Roth IRA](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/iraconversion.asp) by paying taxes that year on the transferred money. If you have a six-figure income, you may exceed IRS limits for contributing to a Roth IRA, but you can still do so [through a backdoor](https://www.investopedia.com/how-to-set-up-a-backdoor-roth-ira-4584775). [↩](#fn2)

<sup id="f3"> 3 </sup> Money in tax-advantaged accounts cannot legally be traded on [margin](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/margin.asp), so IRAs and HSAs are still less capable than a taxable brokerage account. A feature called limited margin is allowed, which allows you to re-use funds immediately instead of being subject to a two-day [settlement period](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/settlement_period.asp), as is required in a cash account. By design, limited margin does not permit [leverage](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/leverage.asp). [↩](#fn3)
