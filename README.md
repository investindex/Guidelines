# Guidelines for financial planning

There is no perfect distribution of stocks, bonds, and other assets. This depends on many factors. Health, age, debt, income, job security, marriage status, children (or plans to have them), risk tolerance, and your personal goals — these are only some of them. The broad goal here is to provide tools to assess what investments fit your situation. However, a few guidelines discussed below can be applied broadly, and we'll also cover important personal finance topics not directly related to investing.

&nbsp;

## Minimize risk of catastrophic loss

First, avoid extreme investment risks. Investing can be most hazardous when using debt or [leverage](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/leverage.asp): using [margin](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/margin.asp) features in a brokerage account or loans to invest in real estate, for instance. Leverage is not always dangerous, but it puts you at greater risk of large losses. Any use of borrowed funds creates the possibility of losing more than you invested, replacing what was once an asset with unexpected debt. Although I wouldn’t discourage all uses of leverage — a home mortgage is a form of leverage — none of the investment options recommended here use it (outside of the [advanced topics](https://github.com/investindex/Advanced)).

Second, _always_ have insurance for extremely valuable physical assets like your car and home, as well as health insurance. Even if your car has low value, liability coverage is vital for car insurance. Without it, you could find yourself paying the medical bills of someone you injured in a car accident. Understand the coverage you’re entitled to, so that you’re not subject to surprise denials. Once you’ve achieved some financial stability, seriously consider purchasing disability insurance. Almost everyone's most valuable asset is not something that comprises their current wealth — it is their capacity to earn income. Social Security disability payments are probably not enough to support you if you’re unable to continue earning income. You may be able to purchase disability insurance through your employer; this can be less expensive but it may not be tailored to your needs and usually lacks portability if you change employers.

If anyone else depends on your future income, purchasing life insurance is a way to safeguard them. The most suitable type for nearly everyone is [term life insurance](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/termlife.asp) (instead of [whole life insurance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AgBhy8iXjpI), which tends to benefit the commissioned salesperson at the expense of the customer). For instance, a 30-year-old who was married last year and has a kid on the way would be well-advised to start getting quotes for 20- to 30-year term life insurance. If they're healthy, they will pay a cheap, fixed premium every year for the term of 20-30 years, and will receive a payout if they die during the term. Coverage [varies](https://www.investopedia.com/which-types-of-deaths-are-not-covered-by-life-insurance-5094285), but in general, death due to an accident, natural causes, murder, or even suicide under certain conditions will qualify for a payout. The younger you are when you start the term, the cheaper your premiums will be. Finally, your most basic financial priority should be to build or maintain an [emergency fund](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vftjBTjFlzI) after paying off credit card debt.

Many people don’t take these actions or, if their finances are chronically strained, are unable to. But be aware that if you neglect to protect yourself, there will be an ever-present risk of financial ruin. Insurance may seem like a waste of money when times are good, but never forget that unpredictable, unavoidable events can shatter your life in an instant. Nothing can bankrupt you faster than expensive tragedies like a health crisis without health insurance.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

## Debt and investment

Pay debt instead of holding bonds or cash, and pay high-interest debt instead of holding stocks. Someone with low-interest loans — let’s say less than 4% [APY](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/apy.asp) — should not invest in bonds or hold large amounts of cash. This [usually includes someone](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKc01jo1qLw) with a home mortgage. Someone paying high interest — a 7% student loan or a 20% credit card loan — should not invest in the stock market either. A tax-free and risk-free 7% annualized return is achieved by every payment on a 7% APY loan. This is preferable to the higher average return from stocks, because the latter carries far more risk and will be taxed. Of course, you should address debt with the highest interest rate first; for many people this is credit card debt. All super high-interest loans like these should be paid off before investing or even building an [emergency fund](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vftjBTjFlzI). The exact interest rate thresholds depend on your risk tolerance and marginal tax rate. See this footnote<sup id="fn1">[[1]](#f1)</sup> for an example that works out the mathematics of comparing debt payments to investing.

One other consideration is important. If needed, money invested in stocks or bonds can be easily liquidated. In contrast, a drawback of paying debt is that the decision can’t be easily reversed. The money is paid back, and would need to be borrowed again if you had an unexpected need for it. However, paying debt can be a very attractive equivalent of investing, as the footnote illustrates.

Ensure you know the distinction between APR and APY; banks advertise APR for loans and APY for savings accounts.

## Fraud prevention

Financial fraud is unfortunately a common occurrence. There are a number of simple actions and habits anyone can use to drastically lower the probability of being a victim of fraud.

The fraud protection for credit cards is fundamentally [better](https://www.experian.com/blogs/ask-experian/are-credit-cards-safer-than-debit-cards/) than the protection for debit cards. When you use a debit card, you're spending your own money; when you use a credit card, you're spending the card issuer's money, which the card issuer is incentivized to protect. The best policy is to __lock your debit card__ with your bank's mobile app and temporarily unlock it only when you need it for ATM use. For spending, use credit cards exclusively. This will prevent any unauthorized use of your debit card or its information. If you're unable to be approved for a credit card right now, see the [personal finance subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/) for advice on building credit. It's a fantastic resource for all topics in personal finance (their guide to credit is [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/index#wiki_credit)). Locking (AKA freezing) your debit card does not prevent use of your checking account, like direct deposit or credit card payments. It affects only the debit card.

__Check your bank account__ and credit card accounts often, at least weekly. Sign up for all possible alerts. I personally receive an alert whenever there is a withdrawal from or deposit to my bank account, whenever a card is charged, and whenever personal information on file (like my address) is changed. I strongly encourage you to activate __two-factor authentication__ so that you confirm all logins using your phone or email. This may seem tedious but it greatly enhances the security of your accounts. Most phones now make the process seamless by autofilling with the number received over text, although verification that does not use [SMS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SMS) is more secure. Adding two-factor authentication to your brokerage account has the added benefit of making it slightly less tempting to check your account value too often.

__Keep your electronic devices locked__ and don't share passwords with anyone unless you completely trust them. Most people do not consider how much of their information is vulnerable after simply bypassing the lock on their phone or computer. Perpetrators of fraud are [sometimes](https://www.thisamericanlife.org/587/transcript) family [members](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/7az4qo/my_brother_has_been_stealing_from_me/), and because most people would be reluctant to pursue criminal charges against a family member, they may have no recourse. Features that provide a high level of security like two-factor authentication are only as secure as your devices. Don't assume that your unlocked phone or laptop is safe simply because it's always with you. In [one story](https://web.archive.org/web/20220306100424/https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/06/business/payments-fraud-zelle-banks.html) reported by the NYT, a man's phone was stolen while he was hospitalized and the thief used his phone to steal and spend thousands of dollars.

In addition, ensure that your wallet and physical cards are in a known and safe location at all times. __Digital wallet services__ like Google Pay, Apple Pay, and Samsung Pay __are more secure__ than physical cards because a process called [tokenization](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-apple-pay-works-under-the-hood-8c3978238324/) means that your card information is never revealed to the merchant. This is true for online shopping as well, so use those services or others like PayPal during checkout when possible. Many ATMs allow you to use your debit card from your digital wallet, which is more secure because it protects [you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5b1axnNK-wI) [from](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyS1RR4U57s&t=74s) [card](https://www.csoonline.com/article/3530302/credit-card-skimmers-explained-how-they-work-and-how-to-protect-yourself.html) [skimmers](https://review42.com/resources/credit-card-skimmer/). If possible, go inside your bank and do deposits and withdrawals with a teller. Not only is this more secure, it avoids ATM malfunctions which are [surprisingly common](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/search/?q=ATM). ATMs from both local credit unions and the largest banks sometimes just eat your [cash](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/t496ne/td_bank_screwed_me_out_of_hundreds_of_dollars/) or [check](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/snmpbi/wells_fargo_atm_ate_my_500_check_and_wont_deposit/). For checks, use mobile check deposits rather than an ATM.

Don't use the same password for Netflix and your bank account. You don't need to generate a different series of 20 random characters for every account in your life. But you'll naturally be less secretive about your Netflix password and it may seem like no big deal to share with a family member or friend. __Keep passwords for your banking and brokerage activity utterly separate from others.__ Your email is how other passwords can be reset, so ensure that your email password is also separate from casual accounts.

__Know who has access__ to each of your bank and credit accounts. If you notice activity you can't explain, you need to know who to contact before reporting fraud. There are two important reasons: (1) you want to avoid false positives, in which you report fraudulent activity but soon find out that it was normal; and (2) you want to be able to report real fraud as soon as possible, so you should know who could be responsible for activity in your account. To reduce this potential confusion, minimize the number of accounts and cards to which anyone else has access, and be very careful about who is allowed access. Your accounts are only as secure as the weakest access point, and that access point could be the negligence of another person you've trusted with your account.

Don't fall into the trap of assuming that you're an unlikely target of fraud because there is not much money in your bank account. Testimonies on the personal finance subreddit show that it's all too common for people with less than $10,000 in their checking accounts to find that their money has been stolen. For example, people have found that thousands of dollars disappeared from their account due to multiple ATM withdrawals or debit card charges before they noticed. Following the advice above prevents this: lock your debit card, turn on activity alerts, and check your account often. There are [many](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/m8l9lx/bofa_denied_my_debit_card_fraud_claim_and_refused/), [many](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/5dnijg/bank_of_america_is_refusing_to_give_back_9800_to/) [people](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/ugp1j2/stranger_found_my_debit_card_and_spent_300/) who would've been saved from fraud by simply locking their debit card.

Consider keeping a __categorized budget__ and recording all spending in a spreadsheet. The act of comparing your accounts against your recorded spending will keep you from overlooking small, dispersed fraud. Many people [fail to notice](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/s55llt/update_someone_charged_my_wifes_card_132_times_on/) these kinds of purchases because their account value is not strongly affected at any one time, and because they don't pay close attention to their account activity. It's easy to let a busy life get in the way of keeping track of your money — try not to let it. Recording your spending is also important for planning your future, because you have to know how much you spend in order to know how much to save and invest.

__Go paperless__. Change your settings so that you minimize mail from your bank, broker, insurance provider, retirement account administrator, and others with any sensitive information.

To some people, focusing on security to this degree may seem like overkill. I'll simply say that these measures would have appeared paranoid to many people who became preventable victims of fraud. Like insurance, security measures are not meant to feel convenient or make you happy. Hopefully imagining the feelings of regret and stress that accompany a fraud investigation will motivate you to take the steps described here _before_ anything bad happens. Reading posts on the [personal finance subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/) by people requesting advice after being defrauded may serve as additional motivation.

See this footnote<sup id="fn2">[[2]](#f2)</sup> for info on good banking practices, some of which are related to security and fraud prevention.

See this footnote<sup id="fn3">[[3]](#f3)</sup> for info on how __freezing your credit__ protects you.

#### Interpersonal fraud

Scams are abundant, and while some are too obvious for anyone but your oldest relatives to fall for, others can be tricky. If a stranger sends you money with a service like Venmo or PayPal, and contacts you saying it was an accident, do not send the money back. This is a [well-documented scam](https://fraudpreventionunit.org/2021/07/21/watch-out-for-this-venmo-scam/). Their transaction using stolen credentials will eventually be reversed after being identified as fraud; you will be stuck with a loss of whatever you willingly sent them. It's in the same family as [fake](https://web.archive.org/web/20220228013242/https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/21/your-money/fake-check-scam.html) [check](https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/how-spot-avoid-and-report-fake-check-scams) [scams](https://www.reddit.com/r/Scams/comments/t2xb0p/feels_like_a_check_scam_but_whats_the_end_goal/), although it is much easier to fall for the Venmo scam if you're not aware of it.

Another tactic by fraudsters is to induce panic and a sense of urgency. This discourages you from thinking clearly or taking the time to consult others. One form of this tactic is the so-called [grandparent scam](https://www.fbi.gov/news/stories/the-grandparent-scam), which is so widespread that I personally know two people who have been targeted. A parent or grandparent receives a call telling them that something terrible has happened to their child or grandchild. It often involves a claim that they've been arrested (perhaps due to hitting a pregnant woman in a car accident). Other variants include being stuck in a foreign country or suffering an injury. Sometimes the caller will claim to be the grandchild; sometimes they will play the part of a lawyer, police officer, or doctor. They may have gathered personal information from the internet to create a plausible story, although some of the lazier ones will not even know the grandchild's name. The interaction will quickly reach a request for money, which is urgently needed for lawyer's fees, bail, or medical bills. The prospect of your grandchild being in jail for hitting a pregnant woman is so daunting that many people fail to step back and consider whether the situation and the proposed solution make sense. If someone is urging you to send money quickly for any reason, you would be well-advised to question everything they say. In a funny local news story, one grandmother quickly recognized the scam and [had the caller arrested](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4dMYdKBHmk) after she pretended to hand him money.

Many fraudsters live outside the US, and poor English or even manners of speech can be a hint that the person is not who they claim to be. A surprisingly widespread cue is the word "[kindly](https://www.reddit.com/r/Scams/comments/tdfsh6/can_we_get_an_emoji_or_top_banner_with_this_on_it/)". Fraudsters in countries that are former British colonies, like India and Nigeria, don't seem to realize that frequent use of the word "kindly" is not a hallmark of American speech. It's hard to believe how strongly this word is associated with scams until you [see it for yourself](https://www.reddit.com/r/Scams/search/?q=kindly).

If a company calls and asks you to call back at a particular number, don’t call that number. Check the company’s website for their official number, and call _that_ number. A common tactic by fraudsters is to represent themselves as a trusted party and ask you to call back at a number of their choosing. Or if you pick up, they will do the same, claiming to be Amazon or Medicare or your bank and asking you to confirm some information. Never give anyone personal info, like your [Social](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Erp8IAUouus) [Security](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_Security_number#Identity_theft) number, unless you’re certain you're speaking to the trusted party. Caller ID can be faked and should never be trusted. The same goes for email addresses: the preview will show that it's from Google, then when you check the specific address, you find that it was sent from \<mypr871@v7T3.ismn.us> (not a real address). URLs that are highly similar to their legitimate counterparts can also be deceptive.

It doesn't matter how much information a caller has: they may know your name, your address, and the last four digits of your credit card number. Your phone may have indicated they were calling or texting from your bank. All of that can be faked. A scammer will try to make the call seem urgent, often by telling you that some sort of fraud has already occurred in your account. No matter how urgent it may seem, you should never give sensitive information to anyone who called you. Be cautious and patient: hang up and call the official customer service number. If the general number is unsuitable, you can ask the caller which number you should call, but make sure the number can be found on the organization's official website (or on the back of your credit/debit card). If a scammer manages to convince you that they're a representative of your bank (or another company), they may trigger two-factor authentication in your account and use you to provide them with the verification code. I will reiterate: you should _never_ provide info like this unless you called an official number of the trusted party. See [this article](https://web.archive.org/web/20220306100424/https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/06/business/payments-fraud-zelle-banks.html) for an example of someone who fell for such a scam: "In Mr. Faunce’s case, it started with a text message that appeared to come from Wells Fargo’s fraud department, asking him to verify whether he had made a payment through Zelle." Mr. Faunce also didn't consider why the bank would urgently need his help to correct the fraud, using a method that would be convoluted and silly if it were real.

In general, follow your gut: no one will ever award you money if you didn't enter a lottery; no one will ever want to be paid in gift cards; no one will ever try to overpay you when you're selling your couch on Facebook Marketplace (see [fake](https://web.archive.org/web/20220228013242/https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/21/your-money/fake-check-scam.html) [check](https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/how-spot-avoid-and-report-fake-check-scams) [scams](https://www.reddit.com/r/Scams/comments/t2xb0p/feels_like_a_check_scam_but_whats_the_end_goal/)). When selling items in person to unknown parties, transact strictly in cash. If something doesn't seem to make sense, take the time to think, ask others, and do research. The [scams subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/Scams/) is a great forum to ask about scams or see posts by those who have been targeted. If you read enough posts, the common hallmarks of scams will soon become glaringly obvious.

&nbsp;

If you conclude with confidence that someone has stolen your money or spent it fraudulently, it is best to file a police report as soon as possible. This alerts your bank to the gravity of the situation, and will encourage them not to drag their feet, for which they are notorious. If your fraud claims are unsuccessful, you may also want to file a report with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and/or the FBI.

&nbsp;

## Simplify your investments, don't simplify your thinking

Index funds are useful because they invest in a shifting collection of hundreds or thousands of securities, which would be an onerous task for anyone without access to institutional resources. They illustrate that simple solutions can be superior to complex solutions. There are expanding offerings for the ultimate simplification: all-in-one asset allocation funds. They allow you to select a single fund based on allocation, such as 80% stocks and 20% bonds, and provide you with an automatically [rebalanced](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/rebalancing.asp), globally diversified assembly of stocks and bonds. There are all-in-one mutual funds from [Vanguard](https://investor.vanguard.com/investment-products/mutual-funds/life-strategy-funds) and [Schwab](https://www.schwab.com/mutual-funds/mutual-fund-portfolio/market-track-portfolios), as well as all-in-one ETFs from BlackRock with allocations of [80/20](https://www.ishares.com/us/products/239729/ishares-aggressive-allocation-etf), [60/40](https://www.ishares.com/us/products/239756/ishares-growth-allocation-etf), [40/60](https://www.ishares.com/us/products/239765/ishares-moderate-allocation-etf), and [30/70](https://www.ishares.com/us/products/239733/ishares-conservative-allocation-etf). Although using one of these is far better than not investing, they carry a hazard.

When you decide how much money to save and invest, you should consider why you are investing: retirement or other long-term goals, college tuition, a vacation, a down payment on a car or house. Assigning purposes to various portions of your money forces you to consider which investments are appropriate for each portion. All-in-one funds, on the other hand, may cause someone to vaguely reflect on the level of risk they desire, without ever thinking through how they would distribute each portion to specific buckets like stocks, long-term bonds, and short-term bonds. If stocks crash, they may realize their stock allocation was too heavy; or if stocks have a brilliant run-up, they may wish they hadn't held so much in bonds. Whatever degree of complexity you choose, ensure that your allocation will produce an acceptable outcome regardless of how the stock market behaves in the near future. The only way to do this is through deliberate planning, not vague assessment of your risk tolerance.

I'll suggest the following outline depending on the time horizon for a given portion of someone's assets:
* 8+ years: stocks
* 4-8 years: stocks + high-yield bonds + high-quality, intermediate- and long-term bonds
* 2-4 years: high-yield bonds + (mostly) high-quality bonds
* Less than 2 years: high-quality, short-term bonds + cash/money market fund

As addressed in the topic below, this is a very general proposal and, as vague as it is, it is still not appropriate for everyone. Someone may also want to consider the maximium drawdown they're willing to tolerate. If they have savings assigned to uses in the next two years but they don't need every dollar, they may invest in an aggregate bond fund instead of a short-term bond fund, with awareness of the possibility that they will sell at a loss.

Another drawback of all-in-one asset allocation funds is that you can't choose to withdraw only from stocks or only from bonds. If you need money during a stock market downturn, you sell stocks at a loss by selling shares even if you'd like to sell only bonds. An easy way to remedy this is by investing in [VT](https://investor.vanguard.com/investment-products/etfs/profile/vt) and [BNDW](https://investor.vanguard.com/investment-products/etfs/profile/bndw) instead. This is still a very simple portfolio, but allows you to withdraw from the bond fund without selling stocks.

Target retirement funds are another type of all-in-one fund. They increase bond allocation over time as investors gradually approach a given retirement year (e.g., [Vanguard Target Retirement Fund 2040](https://investor.vanguard.com/investment-products/mutual-funds/profile/vforx)). These are great as a default investment in 401(k) accounts, but I don't encourage them for people who are willing to devote any time to this. Deciding on a stock/bond allocation is a task most people can handle, especially those willing to read a guide like this. Allowing a default [glide path](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/glide-path.asp) to dictate your asset allocation is often not in your best interest. Moreover, be aware that target retirement funds are [not always sensitive](https://www.wsj.com/articles/vanguard-target-retirement-tax-bill-surprise-11642781228) to those using the fund in a taxable account. They may have large capital gains distributions to which their tax-advantaged 401(k) investors are indifferent. So even if you decide on a target retirement fund in your retirement account, __do not__ do so in a taxable account.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

## Allocation and time horizon

People with higher net worth relative to their financial needs have longer time horizons, and benefit from allocating more heavily to stocks. This can be illustrated with an extreme case. A person with $4 million in liquid net worth could withdraw [about 2.5% each year](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BScK-QyWIo) — $100,000 in the first year before taxes — and live on these withdrawals indefinitely by holding a 100% stock portfolio. Not only would this person not deplete their assets, but because the withdrawals are conservative, the value of their investments would grow over the long run in virtually any plausible future stock market. Hopefully it is clear that for this person, seeking the supposed safety of bonds would encumber the long-term growth of their portfolio and make depletion of their assets _more_ likely.

For the majority of Americans who are not multimillionaires, how can this principle be applied? If there is a portion of your savings you are reserving for the future and don’t plan to use for a number of years,<sup id="fn4">[[4]](#f4)</sup> on average you will benefit most by investing it in 100% stocks. (This does not imply that your stock allocation should be limited to long-term reserves.) For many people this description applies readily to a tax-advantaged retirement account. If you will not need to draw on your retirement funds in the next eight years, your retirement portfolio will have the strongest expected growth with 100% stocks. Any inclusion of bonds will attenuate its long-term value. For some this statement will seem obvious, but it is a widespread practice to include bonds in long-term retirement portfolios. The justification often does not seem to be that part of the money needs to be secure for potential premature access, but that the volatility of a 100% stock portfolio is emotionally uncomfortable.

Footnotes:

<sup id="f1"> 1 </sup> To compare debt repayment to investing, we need to account for taxes that would be paid on the investment. Let's imagine that we're someone with a typical level of income for investors, so we're subject to a 24% marginal federal tax rate for ordinary income and a 15% federal tax rate for [long-term capital gains](https://github.com/investindex/Taxes). And let's say we live in a state that taxes both short- and long-term capital gains at 5%. So for short-term capital gains, we will be taxed at a rate of 29% (24% federal + 5% state), and for long-term capital gains, we will be taxed at a rate of 20% (15% federal + 5% state). We have two sources of debt: a student loan accruing interest at 5% [APY](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/apy.asp) and a home mortgage accruing interest at 3% APY. Payments on the 5% debt are equivalent to annualized short-term capital gains of .05/(1-.29) = 7.04%, and annualized long-term capital gains of .05/(1-.2) = 6.25%. Payments on the 3% debt are equivalent to annualized short-term capital gains of .03/(1-.29) = 4.23%, and annualized long-term capital gains of .03/(1-.2) = 3.75%. If we anticipate chiefly long-term capital gains from investing in stock funds, we can estimate that payments on the student loan are equivalent to a risk-free annualized return of 6.25%, and payments on the home mortgage are equivalent to a risk-free annualized return of 3.75%.

It would be sensible to recognize that the equivalent of a risk-free 6.25% annual return is a great deal, and to first pay off the student loan while making no more than minimum payments on the home mortgage. During this period we would not invest, or save large amounts of cash beyond an emergency fund. (The main exception would be contributing to tax-advantaged accounts with employer matching, as discussed in [this section](https://github.com/investindex/Guidelines#tax-advantaged-accounts).) After completely paying off the student loan, we could begin allocating money to a stock portfolio. Our expected return from the stock portfolio might be 8-10% annually before taxes, which is about 6.4-8.0% after taxes. This is significantly higher than the risk-free 3% gains from making extra payments on the home mortgage. A stock portfolio also has the benefit of liquidity, while the cash value of home equity is hard to access if it's needed. The amount of the student loan or the mortgage is not relevant to these considerations, although some people irrationally might want to [pay off smaller debts first](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNmFrw0kdfM). Ben Felix explains in [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKc01jo1qLw) why it often makes sense to pay off your mortgage instead of allocating a large fraction of your taxable portfolio to bonds. After paying off the mortgage, we could begin increasing the allocation to bonds in the taxable portfolio, so that it fits whatever level of risk we find appropriate.

Someone might challenge this and say I haven't covered all the possibilities. What if instead of paying debt or adding to a taxable brokerage account, we invest additional money in a tax-advantaged account? This eliminates the drawback of paying taxes on realized capital gains. Indeed, these calculations are worth going over, but tax-advantaged accounts carry penalties for unqualified withdrawals. People should exercise care and ensure they have a sizable emergency fund if they choose this alternative. If we were to lose our job and the ability to pay our debt from our paycheck, liquidating investments in a taxable brokerage account is much easier and less costly than doing so in a tax-advantaged account. The only penalty-free distributions from tax-advantaged accounts we can call on at any time before age 59½ are (1) withdrawal of contributions (but not earnings) from a Roth IRA (but not Roth 401(k)), and (2) reimbursement for previously paid bills from an HSA.

<sup id="f2"> 2 </sup> We've already covered locking your debit card, spending only with credit cards, turning on activity alerts, using two-factor authentication, using a digital wallet, keeping your devices locked, using unique passwords, going paperless, and minimizing use of ATMs (mainly for large deposits). In this footnote I'd like to add a few assorted pieces of advice.

In 2019 _The New York Times_ published an article called "[Safe deposit boxes aren't safe](https://web.archive.org/web/20220313114645/https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/19/business/safe-deposit-box-theft.html)". It reported on people who have lost extremely valuable items that were stored in safe deposit boxes, and how banks successfully reject liability for such losses. The article featured a watchmaker who lost millions of dollars in rare watches that he had entrusted to his bank's safe deposit boxes. He was quoted saying, “My impression about safe deposit boxes was that it was like you were putting things in Fort Knox." Many people make the same mistaken assumption.

Keep a checking account with more than one bank. I think most people are unaware that a bank can terminate its relationship with you at their discretion, and that this happens to normal people. In a majority of cases, this is due to the customer's poor conduct, like overdrawing the account or leaving it dormant for a long time. It could also be due to depositing a [bad check](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/ikkbn3/bank_of_america_refusing_to_give_me_my_money_back/), even if you fell victim to a scam and did it unintentionally. But banks can also close your accounts on mere suspicion of fraudulent activity, with the motivation of [avoiding](https://web.archive.org/web/20220202230807/https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/28/business/wells-fargo-fraud-closing-accounts.html) the paperwork and perceived risk that accompanies such a customer. Most customers are worth very little (or even have a negative value) to their bank, so a customer who causes issues is an expense. It doesn't matter whether your activity is truly fraudulent or if it [seemed completely normal](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/5n3prf/help_multiple_number_of_bank_accounts_closed_for/) to you: they don't have to prove or explain [anything](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/hmej3b/ally_bank_closed_my_checking_and_my_savings/). Let's consider the core services used in the checking account of a typical person: money goes in from direct deposits, and throughout each month money goes out for rent or mortgage payments and various credit card payments (at a minimum). This train cannot stop for long without causing serious trouble: without an account, they won't be able to receive direct deposits, and they may not be able to pay their bills on time. If the account is frozen, they won't have access to their money; and if it's not, they'll have to wait for the check to arrive in the mail. If their credit card is issued by the same bank, the credit card account would likely be closed at the same time. In the best case scenario, sudden loss of a bank account is a major inconvenience. How can you prepare so the impact will be minimized if this happens to you? Personally I keep checking accounts with two major banks. I divide each direct deposit between them, and I alternate all credit card and rent payments between them so that if I lose access to one account, I know I can pay from the other account because I've already been doing it on a regular basis. Both accounts have ACH connection to other financial services I use, like my brokerage account and Venmo. Both banks allow me to lock my debit card from the mobile app, which is an essential security feature.

Before moving to the next item, we should clarify some terms. A [credit card issuer](https://www.thebalance.com/credit-card-issuer-959984) is the institution that approves you for a credit card and extends credit. Issuers are banks and credit unions like Capital One, Chase, and Bank of America. This is distinct from the payment network, like Visa or MasterCard. Some cards are associated with a third party, the [co-branded partner](https://www.experian.com/blogs/ask-experian/everything-you-need-to-know-about-credit-card-issuers/). A co-branded partner might be Apple, Amazon, Target, Verizon, or Southwest Airlines. For example, the Apple Card is issued by Goldman Sachs, its payment processor is MasterCard, and its co-branded partner is Apple. Unlike the other institutions mentioned so far, American Express and Discover occupy two roles: they are credit card issuers _and_ payment processors. The [fees](https://www.shopify.com/retail/credit-card-processing) paid by a merchant that accepts credit cards are split between four to five parties: the credit card user in the form of rewards; the card issuer; the payment network; the merchant's payment processor (e.g., [Square](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Square_(payment_system))); and the digital wallet service, if any.

Use more than one credit card, and don't rely on a single issuer for your credit cards. The first reason for this is related to the comment above on bank accounts: it is unwise to rely on a single institution for essential financial services. Some people are unwittingly in a precarious situation: they depend entirely on a single bank for their checking account and their credit card. If the bank decided to terminate the relationship, they would suddenly be without a bank account or a credit card. This would temporarily limit them to cash, [prepaid debit cards](https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/banking/best-prepaid-debit-cards), and [money orders](https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/banking/money-orders) (or help from family and friends, which not everyone has). If a credit card is permanently closed, or needs to be replaced and is temporarily unavailable, having access to multiple cards preserves your ability to spend money (even if a bank account closes at the same time). Rewards are an additional compelling reason to use multiple credit cards. You can choose cards with complementary rewards: a card with a high flat reward rate like 2% cash back on all purchases, supplemented with other cards that provide higher rewards in certain spending categories. Finally, using multiple credit cards can help your credit score, partly because increasing your total credit limit decreases your [credit utilization rate](https://www.experian.com/blogs/ask-experian/credit-education/score-basics/credit-utilization-rate/). This rate should ideally be less than 10% at the end of each monthly [billing cycle](https://www.thebalance.com/billing-cycle-960690). You can exceed that _during_ the billing cycle, because your utilization throughout the month is not reported to credit bureaus. If you want to optimize your credit score, you can read about the [all zero except one](https://thefirestarterpack.com/credit-utilization-basics-and-azeo-method) method, but that's a minor nuance. Note that leaving (say) a 1% balance on a credit card does not mean you would pay interest — you should never pay credit card interest! Paying off your entire _statement balance_ each month prevents interest, but you can still have a nonzero _current balance_ at the end of the cycle. To summarize the last few paragraphs: for the sake of convenience and continuous access to financial services, use multiple bank accounts and multiple credit cards.

Your account and routing numbers may seem like information that isn't very private. You freely provide them to your employer for direct deposit and to numerous other institutions for ACH transfers. The numbers are even printed on your checks in machine-readable block letters! This may give some people the wrong impression. Your account and routing numbers should be provided strictly on a need-to-know basis. You might notice that to pay your credit card bill, linking the bank account that pays the bill requires no authentication. This is how certain payments work in the US: all you need are those two numbers. While of course an unauthorized use of this information is illegal, I have tried to emphasize repeatedly that addressing fraud after it has occurred is perhaps 100-1000x more effortful than preventing it. Your account and routing numbers should never be posted publicly.

<sup id="f3"> 3 </sup> There are three main credit bureaus to which your credit-related information is reported: [Experian](https://www.experian.com), [Equifax](https://www.equifax.com), and [TransUnion](https://www.transunion.com). If you haven’t, you should create accounts with each and ensure that the credit information is accurate. Experian and Equifax have decent websites; TransUnion’s website is hellish and designed to extract money from you. TransUnion doesn't make it easy to learn this from their website, but the "TrueIdentity" feature is how you access information for free. Be aware that there are two proprietary algorithms for calculating credit scores: a FICO score and a VantageScore. The FICO score is predominant and it's the score you should be most concerned with; the VantageScore was created more recently and is not usually attended to by lenders. In addition, there are many variants of each score. Credit bureaus are also called credit reporting agencies (CRAs).

As explained [here](https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/what-know-about-credit-freezes-and-fraud-alerts), a credit freeze prevents anyone from opening new credit accounts in your name. Even if someone has obtained your Social Security number — which is [much easier](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Erp8IAUouus) than it should be — they cannot use it to open a new account when your credit is frozen. It has a protective effect that is analogous to locking your debit card. See the following links for freezing your credit at [Experian](https://www.experian.com/freeze/center.html), [Equifax](https://www.equifax.com/personal/credit-report-services/credit-freeze/), and [TransUnion](https://www.transunion.com/credit-freeze). The same pages are used for unfreezing your credit.

There are two other companies with which you should freeze your information. [ChexSystems](https://www.chexsystems.com) is a company used by most banks to screen applicants for checking and savings accounts. Freezing your credit at the credit bureaus will prevent others from opening new credit accounts in your name, whereas a freeze with ChexSystems will provide a significant obstacle against others trying to open a bank account in your name. The freeze webpage is [here](https://www.chexsystems.com/web/chexsystems/consumerdebit/page/securityfreeze/information). There is also a fourth, smaller credit bureau called [Innovis](https://www.innovis.com), and their credit freeze link is [here](https://www.innovis.com/personal/securityFreeze). They don't provide the same easy access to information that the big three do and the website is terrible, so it's not a website you'll visit often, but you should freeze your credit with Innovis as well.

An assumption that some people make when they hear the word "freeze" is that freezing your credit information could stop your credit score from changing. This is not true: freezing your credit information has no effect on your credit score, and it will not stop changing. Your credit score will continue to be affected by ongoing payments (or lack thereof).

You need to unfreeze only when a party with whom you do _not_ have a pre-existing credit relationship needs to perform a hard or soft credit inquiry. This may happen when applying for an apartment or in the later stages of a job application, and of course it will happen when you're seeking a loan or a new credit card. Anytime you need to allow an inquiry, you can temporarily lift the freeze, unfreeze, or give them an access code that permits a single-use inquiry while your credit remains frozen. See [this link](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/identity_theft) for more information on those options. I don't suggest using weaker alternatives to freezing like fraud alerts. Even a credit freeze is [not perfect](https://krebsonsecurity.com/2021/04/experians-credit-freeze-security-is-still-a-joke/) given the somewhat lax security at the credit bureaus, but it is the best measure you can take. Even with your credit frozen, you should still check your credit at least monthly.

Upon reading this you may again question how necessary it is. Why would someone steal _my_ identity? I’m no one special. I don’t have enemies. Let me emphasize that identity thieves don’t need to have ever encountered you personally. They may have [stolen your data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2017_Equifax_data_breach) from a credit bureau, a bank, an insurance company, a brokerage firm, an employer, a landlord, or one of the other parties to which you’ve supplied your precious Social Security number. Not having much money doesn’t make you an undesirable target; you may be _more_ desirable because you lack the resources to pursue identity thieves with expensive legal procedures. In response to the charge of paranoia, I will simply state again that pre-emptive action is less bothersome than a fraud investigation after some stranger has saddled you with thousands of dollars of debt in an account with your name on it.

A final note: the credit bureaus are for-profit businesses. They're even publicly listed: see [TRU](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/TRU), [EFX](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/EFX), [EXPN.L](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/EXPN.L). All three, and especially TransUnion, will try to get you to pay them. Products range from "credit lock" to programs that claim to help you boost your credit. I don't suggest paying them for anything; however appealing the products may sound, everything you need is available for free. If you feel inclined to take one of their credit card recommendations (for which they're paid), be sure to research the alternatives first. [↩](#fn3)

<sup id="f4"> 4 </sup> How many years exactly? A weasel word, _number_, is used because there is no perfect answer. The historical evidence suggests that a five-year horizon is sufficient in a large majority of cases, while an eight-year horizon is very safe and will permit you to wait for a recovery from nearly any potential downturn. In US history, only the [Great Depression](https://github.com/investindex/Risk#f6) would violate this rule. [↩](#fn4)
