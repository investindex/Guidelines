# Guidelines for financial planning

There is no perfect distribution of stocks, bonds, and other assets. This depends on many factors. Health, age, debt, income, job security, marriage status, children (or plans to have them), risk tolerance, and your personal goals — these are only some of them. The broad goal here is to provide tools to assess what investments fit your situation. However, a few guidelines discussed below can be applied broadly, and we'll also cover important personal finance topics not directly related to investing.

## Minimize risk of catastrophic loss

First, avoid extreme investment risks. Investing can be most hazardous when using debt or [leverage](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/leverage.asp): using [margin](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/margin.asp) features in a brokerage account or loans to invest in real estate, for instance. Leverage is not always dangerous, but it puts you at greater risk of large losses. Any use of borrowed funds creates the possibility of losing more than you invested, replacing what was once an asset with unexpected debt. Although I wouldn’t discourage all uses of leverage — a home mortgage is a form of leverage — none of the investment options recommended here use it (outside of the [advanced topics](https://github.com/investindex/Advanced)).

Second, _always_ have insurance for extremely valuable physical assets like your car and home, as well as health insurance. Even if your car has low value, liability coverage is vital for car insurance. Without it, you could find yourself paying the medical bills of someone you injured in a car accident. Understand the coverage you’re entitled to, so that you’re not subject to surprise denials. Once you’ve achieved some financial stability, seriously consider purchasing disability insurance. Almost everyone's most valuable asset is not something that comprises their current wealth — it is their capacity to earn income. Social Security disability payments are probably not enough to support you if you’re unable to continue earning income. You may be able to purchase disability insurance through your employer; this can be less expensive but it may not be tailored to your needs and usually lacks portability if you change employers.

If anyone else depends on your future income, purchasing life insurance is a way to safeguard them. The most suitable type for nearly everyone is [term life insurance](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/termlife.asp) (instead of [whole life insurance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AgBhy8iXjpI), which tends to benefit the commissioned salesperson at the expense of the customer). For instance, a 30-year-old who's planning their wedding and would like to have kids in the next few years would be well-advised to start getting quotes for 20- to 30-year term life insurance. If they're healthy, they will pay a cheap, fixed premium every year for the term of 20-30 years, and will receive a payout if they die during the term. Coverage [varies](https://www.investopedia.com/which-types-of-deaths-are-not-covered-by-life-insurance-5094285), but in general, death due to an accident, natural causes, murder, or even suicide under certain conditions will qualify for a payout. The younger you are when you start the term, the cheaper your premiums will be. Finally, your most basic financial priority should be to build or maintain an [emergency fund](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vftjBTjFlzI) after paying off credit card debt.

Many people don’t take these actions or, if their finances are chronically strained, are unable to. But be aware that if you neglect to protect yourself, there will be an ever-present risk of financial ruin. Insurance may seem like a waste of money when times are good, but never forget that unpredictable, unavoidable events can shatter your life in an instant. Nothing can bankrupt you faster than expensive tragedies like a health crisis without health insurance.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

## Debt and investment

Pay debt instead of holding bonds or cash, and pay high-interest debt instead of holding stocks. Someone with low-interest loans — let’s say less than 4% [APY](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/apy.asp) — should not invest in bonds or hold large amounts of cash. This [usually includes someone](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKc01jo1qLw) with a home mortgage. Someone paying high interest — a 7% student loan or a 20% credit card loan — should not invest in the stock market either. A tax-free and risk-free 7% annualized return is achieved by every payment on a 7% APY loan. This is preferable to the higher average return from stocks, because the latter carries far more risk and will be taxed. Of course, you should address debt with the highest interest rate first; for many people this is credit card debt. All super high-interest loans like these should be paid off before investing or even building an [emergency fund](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vftjBTjFlzI). The exact interest rate thresholds depend on your risk tolerance and marginal tax rate. See this footnote<sup id="fn1">[[1]](#f1)</sup> for an example that works out the mathematics of comparing debt payments to investing.

One other consideration is important. If needed, money invested in stocks or bonds can be easily liquidated. In contrast, a drawback of paying debt is that the decision can’t be easily reversed. The money is paid back, and would need to be borrowed again if you had an unexpected need for it. However, paying debt can be a very attractive equivalent of investing, as the footnote illustrates.

Ensure you know the distinction between APR and APY; banks advertise APR for loans and APY for savings accounts.

## Fraud prevention

Financial fraud is unfortunately a common occurrence. There are a number of simple actions and habits anyone can use to drastically lower the probability of being a victim of fraud.

The fraud protection for credit cards is fundamentally [better](https://www.experian.com/blogs/ask-experian/are-credit-cards-safer-than-debit-cards/) than the protection for debit cards. When you use a debit card, you're spending your own money; when you use a credit card, you're spending the card issuer's money, which the card issuer is incentivized to protect. The best policy is to __lock your debit card__ with your bank's mobile app and temporarily unlock it only when you need it for ATM use. For spending, use credit cards exclusively. This will prevent any unauthorized use of your debit card or its information. If you're unable to be approved for a credit card right now, see the [personal finance subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/) for advice on building credit. It's a fantastic resource for all topics in personal finance (their guide to credit is [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/index#wiki_credit)). 

__Check your bank account__ and credit card accounts often, at least twice per week. Sign up for all possible alerts. I personally receive both an email and a mobile alert whenever there is a withdrawal from or deposit to my bank account, whenever a card is charged, and whenever personal information on file (like my address) is changed. I strongly encourage you to activate __two-factor authentication__ so that you confirm all logins using your phone or email. This may seem tedious but it greatly enhances the security of your accounts. Most phones now make the process seamless by autofilling with the number received over text, although verification that does not use [SMS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SMS) is more secure. Adding two-factor authentication to your brokerage account has the added benefit of making it slightly less tempting to check your account value too often.

__Keep your electronic devices locked__ and don't share passwords with anyone unless you completely trust them. Most people do not consider how much of their information is vulnerable after simply bypassing the lock on their phone or computer. Perpetrators of fraud are [sometimes](https://www.thisamericanlife.org/587/transcript) family [members](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/7az4qo/my_brother_has_been_stealing_from_me/), and because most people would be reluctant to pursue criminal charges against a family member, they may have no recourse. Features that provide a high level of security like two-factor authentication are only as secure as your devices. Don't assume that your unlocked phone or laptop is safe simply because it's always with you. In [one story](https://web.archive.org/web/20220306100424/https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/06/business/payments-fraud-zelle-banks.html) reported by the NYT, a man's phone was stolen while he was hospitalized and the thief used his phone to steal and spend thousands of dollars.

In addition, ensure that your wallet and physical cards are in a known and safe location at all times. __Digital wallet services__ like Google Pay, Apple Pay, and Samsung Pay __are more secure__ than physical cards because a process called [tokenization](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-apple-pay-works-under-the-hood-8c3978238324/) means that your card information is never revealed to the merchant. This is true for online shopping as well, so use those services or others like PayPal during checkout when possible. Many ATMs allow you to use your debit card from your digital wallet, which is more secure because it protects [you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5b1axnNK-wI) [from](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyS1RR4U57s&t=74s) [card](https://www.csoonline.com/article/3530302/credit-card-skimmers-explained-how-they-work-and-how-to-protect-yourself.html) [skimmers](https://review42.com/resources/credit-card-skimmer/). If possible, go inside your bank and do deposits and withdrawals with a teller. Not only is this more secure, it avoids ATM malfunctions which are [surprisingly common](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/search/?q=ATM). ATMs from both local credit unions and the largest banks sometimes just eat your [cash](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/t496ne/td_bank_screwed_me_out_of_hundreds_of_dollars/) or [check](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/snmpbi/wells_fargo_atm_ate_my_500_check_and_wont_deposit/). For checks, use mobile check deposits rather than an ATM.

Don't use the same password for Netflix and your bank account. You don't need to generate a different series of 20 random characters for every account in your life. But you'll naturally be less secretive about your Netflix password and it may seem like no big deal to share with a family member or friend. __Keep passwords for your banking and brokerage activity utterly separate from others.__ Your email is how other passwords can be reset, so ensure that your email password is also separate from casual accounts.

__Know who has access__ to each of your bank and credit accounts. If you notice activity you can't explain, you need to know who to contact before reporting fraud. There are two important reasons: (1) you want to avoid false positives, in which you report fraudulent activity but soon find out that it was normal; and (2) you want to be able to report real fraud as soon as possible, so you should know who could be responsible for activity in your account. To reduce this potential confusion, minimize the number of accounts and cards to which anyone else has access, and be very careful about who is allowed access. Your accounts are only as secure as the weakest access point, and that access point could be the negligence of another person you've trusted with your account.

Don't fall into the trap of assuming that you're an unlikely target of fraud because there is not much money in your bank account. Testimonies on the personal finance subreddit show that it's all too common for people with less than $10,000 in their checking accounts to find that their money has been stolen. For example, people have found that thousands of dollars disappeared from their account due to multiple ATM withdrawals or debit card charges before they noticed. Following the advice above prevents this: lock your debit card, turn on activity alerts, and check your account often. There are [many](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/m8l9lx/bofa_denied_my_debit_card_fraud_claim_and_refused/), [many](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/5dnijg/bank_of_america_is_refusing_to_give_back_9800_to/) people who would've been saved from fraud by simply locking their debit card.

Consider keeping a __categorized budget__ and recording all spending in a spreadsheet. The act of comparing your accounts against your recorded spending will keep you from overlooking small, dispersed fraud. Many people [fail to notice](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/s55llt/update_someone_charged_my_wifes_card_132_times_on/) these kinds of purchases because their account value is not strongly affected at any one time, and because they don't pay close attention to their account activity. It's easy to let a busy life get in the way of keeping track of your money — try not to let it. Recording your budget is also important for planning your future, because you have to know how much you spend in order to know how much to save and invest.

__Go paperless__. Change your settings so that you minimize mail from your bank, broker, insurance provider, retirement account administrator, and others with any sensitive information.

To some people, focusing on security to this degree may seem like overkill. I'll simply say that these measures would have appeared paranoid to many people who became preventable victims of fraud. Like insurance, security measures are not meant to feel convenient or make you happy. Hopefully imagining the feelings of regret and stress that accompany a fraud investigation will motivate you to take the steps described here _before_ anything bad happens. Reading posts on the [personal finance subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/) by people requesting advice after being defrauded may serve as additional motivation.

See this footnote<sup id="fn2">[[2]](#f2)</sup> for information on how __freezing your credit__ protects you.

#### Interpersonal fraud

Scams are abundant, and while some are too obvious for anyone but your oldest relatives to fall for, others can be tricky. If a stranger sends you money with a service like Venmo or PayPal, and contacts you saying it was an accident, do not send the money back. This is a [well-documented scam](https://fraudpreventionunit.org/2021/07/21/watch-out-for-this-venmo-scam/). Their transaction using stolen credentials will eventually be reversed after being identified as fraud; you will be stuck with a loss of whatever you willingly sent them. It's in the same family as [fake](https://web.archive.org/web/20220228013242/https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/21/your-money/fake-check-scam.html) [check](https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/how-spot-avoid-and-report-fake-check-scams) [scams](https://www.reddit.com/r/Scams/comments/t2xb0p/feels_like_a_check_scam_but_whats_the_end_goal/), although it is much easier to fall for the Venmo scam if you're not aware of it.

Another tactic by fraudsters is to induce panic and a sense of urgency. This discourages you from thinking clearly or taking the time to consult others. One form of this tactic is the so-called [grandparent scam](https://www.fbi.gov/news/stories/the-grandparent-scam), which is so widespread that I personally know two people who have been targeted. A parent or grandparent receives a call telling them that something terrible has happened to their child or grandchild. It often involves a claim that they've been arrested (perhaps due to hitting a pregnant woman in a car accident). Other variants include being stuck in a foreign country or suffering an injury. Sometimes the caller will claim to be the grandchild; sometimes they will play the part of a lawyer, police officer, or doctor. They may have gathered personal information from the internet to create a plausible story, although some of the lazier ones will not even know the grandchild's name. The interaction will quickly reach a request for money, which is urgently needed for lawyer's fees, bail, or medical bills. The prospect of your grandchild being in jail for hitting a pregnant woman is so daunting that many people fail to step back and consider whether the situation and the proposed solution make sense. If someone is urging you to send money quickly for any reason, you would be well-advised to question everything they say. One grandmother went the extra mile and [had the scammer arrested](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4dMYdKBHmk&ab_channel=CBSNewYork) after she pretended to hand him money.

Many fraudsters live outside the US, and poor English or even manners of speech can be a hint that the person is not who they claim to be. A surprisingly widespread cue is the word "[kindly](https://www.reddit.com/r/Scams/comments/tdfsh6/can_we_get_an_emoji_or_top_banner_with_this_on_it/)". Fraudsters in countries that are former British colonies, like India and Nigeria, don't seem to realize that frequent use of the word "kindly" is not a hallmark of American speech. It's hard to believe how strongly this word is associated with scams until you [see it for yourself](https://www.reddit.com/r/Scams/search/?q=kindly).

If a company calls and asks you to call back at a particular number, don’t call that number. Check the company’s website for their official number, and call _that_ number. A common tactic by fraudsters is to represent themselves as a trusted party and ask you to call back at a number of their choosing. Or if you pick up, they will do the same, claiming to be Amazon or Medicare or your bank and asking you to confirm some information. Never give anyone personal info, like your [Social](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Erp8IAUouus) [Security](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_Security_number#Identity_theft) number, unless you’re certain you're speaking to the trusted party. This includes [someone asking](https://web.archive.org/web/20220306100424/https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/06/business/payments-fraud-zelle-banks.html) for a confirmation/verification code that was texted or emailed to you. Caller ID can be faked and should never be trusted. The same goes for email addresses: the preview will show that it's from Google, then when you check the specific address, you find that it was sent from \<mypr871@v7T3.ismn.us> (not a real address). URLs that are highly similar to their legitimate counterparts can also be deceptive.

It doesn't matter how much information a caller has: they may know your name, your address, and the last four digits of your credit card number. Caller ID may have indicated they were calling from your bank. All of that can be faked. A scammer will try to make the call seem urgent, often by telling you that some sort of fraud has already occurred in your account. No matter how urgent it may seem, you should never give sensitive information to anyone who called you. Be cautious and patient: hang up and call the official customer service number. If the general number is unsuitable, you can ask the caller which number you should call, but make sure the number can be found on the organization's official website. If a scammer manages to convince you that they're a representative of your bank (or another company), they may trigger two-factor authentication in your account and use you to provide them with the verification code. I will reiterate: you should _never_ provide info like this unless you called an official number of the trusted party.

In general, follow your gut: no one will ever send you free money if you didn't enter a lottery; no one will ever want to be paid in gift cards; no one will ever try to overpay you when you're selling your couch on Facebook Marketplace (see [fake](https://web.archive.org/web/20220228013242/https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/21/your-money/fake-check-scam.html) [check](https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/how-spot-avoid-and-report-fake-check-scams) [scams](https://www.reddit.com/r/Scams/comments/t2xb0p/feels_like_a_check_scam_but_whats_the_end_goal/)). When selling items in person to unknown parties, transact strictly in cash. If something doesn't seem to make sense, take the time to think, ask others, and do research (including on the [scams subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/Scams/)).

&nbsp;

If you conclude with confidence that someone has stolen your money or spent it fraudulently, it is best to file a police report as soon as possible. This alerts your bank to the gravity of the situation, and will encourage them not to drag their feet, for which they are notorious. If your fraud claims are unsuccessful, you may also want to file a report with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and/or the FBI.

&nbsp;

## Simplify your investments, don't simplify your thinking

Index funds are useful because they invest in a shifting collection of hundreds or thousands of securities, which would be an onerous task for anyone without access to institutional resources. They illustrate that simple solutions can be superior to complex solutions. There are expanding offerings for the ultimate simplification: all-in-one funds. They allow you to select a single fund based on allocation, such as 60% stocks and 40% bonds, and provide you with an automatically [rebalanced](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/rebalancing.asp), globally diversified assembly of stocks and bonds. There are all-in-one mutual funds from [Vanguard](https://investor.vanguard.com/investment-products/mutual-funds/life-strategy-funds) and [Schwab](https://www.schwab.com/mutual-funds/mutual-fund-portfolio/market-track-portfolios), as well as all-in-one ETFs from BlackRock with allocations of [80/20](https://www.ishares.com/us/products/239729/ishares-aggressive-allocation-etf), [60/40](https://www.ishares.com/us/products/239756/ishares-growth-allocation-etf), [40/60](https://www.ishares.com/us/products/239765/ishares-moderate-allocation-etf), and [30/70](https://www.ishares.com/us/products/239733/ishares-conservative-allocation-etf). Although using one of these is far better than not investing, they carry a hazard.

When you decide how much money to save and invest, you should consider why you are investing: retirement or other long-term goals, college tuition, a vacation, a down payment on a car or house. Assigning purposes to various portions of your money forces you to consider which investments are appropriate for each portion. All-in-one funds, on the other hand, may cause someone to vaguely reflect on the level of risk they desire, without ever thinking through how they would distribute each portion to specific buckets like stocks, long-term bonds, and short-term bonds. If stocks crash, they may realize their stock allocation was too heavy; or if stocks have a brilliant run-up, they may wish they hadn't held so much in bonds. Whatever degree of complexity you choose, ensure that your allocation will produce an acceptable outcome regardless of how the stock market behaves in the near future. The only way to do this is through deliberate planning, not vague assessment of your risk tolerance.

I'll suggest the following outline depending on the time horizon for a given portion of someone's assets:
* 8+ years: stocks
* 4-8 years: stocks + high-yield bonds + high-quality, intermediate- and long-term bonds
* 2-4 years: high-yield bonds + (mostly) high-quality bonds
* Less than 2 years: high-quality, short-term bonds + cash/money market fund

As addressed in the topic below, this is a very general proposal and, as vague as it is, it is still not appropriate for everyone. Someone may also want to consider the maximium drawdown they're willing to tolerate. If they have savings assigned to uses in the next two years but they don't need every dollar, they may invest in an aggregate bond fund instead of a short-term bond fund, with awareness of the possibility that they will sell at a loss.

Target retirement funds are another type of all-in-one fund. They increase bond allocation over time as investors gradually approach a given retirement year (e.g., [Vanguard Target Retirement Fund 2040](https://investor.vanguard.com/investment-products/mutual-funds/profile/vforx)). These are great as a default investment in 401(k) accounts, but I don't encourage them for people who are willing to devote any time to this. Deciding on a stock/bond allocation is a task most people can handle, especially those willing to read a guide like this. Allowing a default [glide path](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/glide-path.asp) to dictate your asset allocation is often not in your best interest. Moreover, be aware that target retirement funds are [not always sensitive](https://www.wsj.com/articles/vanguard-target-retirement-tax-bill-surprise-11642781228) to those using the fund in a taxable account. They may have large capital gains distributions to which their tax-advantaged 401(k) investors are indifferent. So even if you decide on a target retirement fund in your retirement account, _do not_ do so in a taxable account.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

## Allocation and time horizon

People with higher net worth relative to their financial needs have longer time horizons, and benefit from allocating more heavily to stocks. This can be illustrated with an extreme case. A person with $4 million in liquid net worth could withdraw [about 2.5% each year](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BScK-QyWIo) — $100,000 in the first year before taxes — and live on these withdrawals indefinitely by holding a 100% stock portfolio. Not only would this person not deplete their assets, but because the withdrawals are conservative, the value of their investments would grow over the long run in virtually any plausible future stock market. Hopefully it is clear that for this person, seeking the supposed safety of bonds would encumber the long-term growth of their portfolio and make depletion of their assets _more_ likely.

For the majority of Americans who are not multimillionaires, how can this principle be applied? If there is a portion of your savings you are reserving for the future and don’t plan to use for a number of years,<sup id="fn3">[[3]](#f3)</sup> on average you will benefit most by investing it in 100% stocks. (This does not imply that your stock allocation should be limited to long-term reserves.) For many people this description applies readily to a tax-advantaged retirement account. If you will not need to draw on your retirement funds in the next eight years, your retirement portfolio will have the strongest expected growth with 100% stocks. Any inclusion of bonds will attenuate its long-term value. For some this statement will seem obvious, but it is a widespread practice to include bonds in long-term retirement portfolios. The justification often does not seem to be that part of the money needs to be secure for potential premature access, but that the volatility of a 100% stock portfolio is emotionally uncomfortable.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

## Tax-advantaged accounts

#### Retirement accounts

Most tax-advantaged retirement accounts are either an [IRA](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/ira.asp) (individual retirement account) or an employer-sponsored [401(k)](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/1/401kplan.asp) account. They incentivize retirement planning by offering the opportunity to save a great deal on taxes if you set aside the money until old age. In this context, "earnings" or "investment earnings" refer to the growth in value of investments in these accounts. "Distributions" are jargon for withdrawals from the account, and "qualified distributions" are withdrawals that are penalty-free because they comply with the purposes of the account. There are two types of retirement account plans that reduce taxes in different ways, and an individual can use one or both. With a [traditional](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/traditionalira.asp) plan, your contributions are tax-deductible in that year and investments in the account grow without taxation. While no income tax is paid on contributions or investment earnings, withdrawals are taxed as ordinary income. With a [Roth](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/rothira.asp) plan, contributions are taxed like the rest of your income, but earnings in the account and [qualified distributions](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/q/qualifieddistribution.asp) are tax-free. Traditional accounts are tax-deferred, and Roth accounts are tax-exempt. The distinctions introduced so far provide four subdivisions: traditional IRA, Roth IRA, traditional 401(k), and Roth 401(k).

Distributions are meant to be delayed until age 59½, so early withdrawals are hit with a 10% tax penalty on top of triggering any tax owed. You're exempt from penalty if you meet [uncommon criteria](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/q/qualifieddistribution.asp) or you're withdrawing only contributions (but not earnings) from a Roth IRA. Once you turn 59½, you can withdraw any amount penalty-free (additionally, Roth IRAs must have been open for at least five years). If you expect your income to rise over time, it makes sense to contribute to Roth accounts earlier in life and traditional accounts later in life. I explore when to contribute to Roth and traditional accounts [in the section on taxes](https://github.com/investindex/Taxes#roth-or-traditional). You should take advantage of employer matching every year in your 401(k) — even if you have high-interest debt. If there is a 50% [matching policy](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/personal-finance/112315/how-401k-matching-works.asp), you will earn a risk-free, tax-advantaged 50% return simply by contributing up to a certain limit. Even if you later need to withdraw the money prematurely with a 10% penalty, employer matching is not an opportunity you want to miss.

There are two exceptions. The first is if you're drowning in debt, barely able to make interest payments. If you're anywhere close to this situation, you shouldn't be contributing to retirement accounts. The other exception is if you plan to leave your company soon, and your matching contributions to a 401(k) [will not fully vest](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/081815/can-my-company-ever-be-entitled-take-my-401k.asp). What does this mean? To incentivize retention, your employer may require a certain period of working years until your matching contributions belong to you completely. That is, until you are 100% vested, some or all of your matching contributions may be revoked if you leave. If you left while you were 40% vested, the employer would be able to claw back 60% of their contributions. Vesting may increase by 20 percentage points each year, for example, but the schedule is up to the employer except for the legal requirement that it must reach 100% after six years. Once you are 100% vested after six years at most, all prior and future matching contributions are assured regardless of when you leave the company. The [403(b)](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/1/403bplan.asp) account is a close relative to the 401(k) account; one major difference is that employer contributions often vest immediately. Once you have maxed out employer matching in a given year, you can continue tax-deductible contributions up to a limit, or contribute to another tax-advantaged account like a [health savings account (HSA)](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/hsa.asp) or [529 account](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/1/529plan.asp). These two additional account types provide tax advantages while allowing you to use the money for their designated purposes at any time — you don’t have to wait for old age.

The IRS offers a major tax credit to those with low income who contribute to retirement accounts. Read about the saver's credit [here](https://github.com/investindex/Taxes#savers-credit).

TERMINOLOGY WARNING: Many people simply say "401(k)" with the implication of a traditional plan. Most 401(k) accounts _are_ traditional, which means they are tax-deferred accounts. But many employers also offer a Roth 401(k), so it can be important to specify whether you're referring to a traditional 401(k) or a Roth 401(k). One more gripe: please don't capitalize "Roth". It's not an acronym, it's named after [a US senator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Roth).

#### Health savings accounts

Properly used, HSAs have the most tax advantages of any account. Contributions are tax-deductible up to a limit, investments grow tax-free, and withdrawals used for qualifying medical expenses are not taxed. The account can pay for your own medical expenses as well as those of your spouse, dependents, and [certain](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p502#en_US_2021_publink1000178869) non-dependent children. You can pay for medical expenses directly from the account, or you can wait and reimburse yourself later. The delay can be two days or 20 years, as long as you can document the payments and your HSA was open when the expenses were incurred. Documentation is not typically needed for HSA reimbursement, so it may never be used, but the IRS can request it if your tax returns are audited.

Unlike contributions to your IRA or 401(k), contributions to your HSA even [escape](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/09/18/this-triple-tax-advantaged-account-might-beat-your-401k-plan.html) FICA taxes, which fund Social Security and Medicare, as long as you contribute through your employer’s payroll deduction. For [most people](https://github.com/investindex/Taxes#the-essentials), FICA taxes amount to 7.65% of every dollar of income. Your employer may offer matching in your HSA because this enables them to pay you while escaping their share of FICA taxes too. HSAs do have a drawback: if you desperately need the money and withdraw it for non-medical reasons before age 65, you’ll pay a penalty of 20% — twice as high as in retirement accounts — in addition to income taxes. From a retirement perspective, you can use your HSA purely as an investment vehicle. After age 65, you can use it for medical expenses as you would have before, but the 20% penalty if you withdraw for other reasons will be gone. The withdrawals for non-medical reasons will be subject to income tax, but so would withdrawals from a traditional IRA or 401(k). Even in this situation, the HSA is superior because the contributions avoid FICA tax on the front end, but contributions to an IRA or 401(k) do not.<sup id="fn4">[[4]](#f4)</sup> An HSA is a stealth retirement account that beats retirement accounts at their own job.

You shouldn’t feel the need to choose between a dichotomy of investing or not investing in your HSA. If it suits you, you can spend some of your HSA funds on medical expenses throughout your life while investing a portion for old age. If you commit to [an investment approach](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/personal-finance/091615/how-use-your-hsa-retirement.asp), you should max out HSA contributions every year and refrain from spending any of your HSA funds before 65, so that they appreciate maximally. You would pay for medical expenses before 65 from your checking account, not your HSA. This is a little counterintuitive, but it would allow your untaxed HSA contributions to spiral upward with tax-free capital gains, and much of the money would be withdrawn tax-free as well. As you age during retirement, you will probably spend [far more](https://www.soa.org/resources/research-reports/2013/research-health-care-birth-death/) on medical expenses than when you were younger, and maximizing your HSA would mean you’re able to fund those [large expenses](https://newsroom.fidelity.com/press-releases/news-details/2021/Fidelitys-20th-Annual-Retiree-Health-Care-Cost-Estimate-Hits-New-High-A-Couple-Retiring-Today-Will-Need-300000-to-Cover-Medical-Expenses-an-88-Increase-Since-2002/default.aspx) with invested money that has never been taxed. A small added bonus is that you benefit from credit card rewards by not paying with your HSA debit card; you can do this even if you don't invest in your HSA, and immediately withdraw the amount from your HSA after paying with your credit card.

HSAs can pay for a variety of health care expenses that may be surprising — not just co-pays, co-insurance, and deductibles. Eligible expenses [include](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p502#en_US_2021_publink1000178887) eyeglasses and contact lenses, braces, certain OTC medications like aspirin and ibuprofen, childbirth classes, therapy and psychiatric care, guide dog expenses, changes you make to your home for medical reasons, sunscreen, tampons and pads, hearing aids, and out-of-pocket transportation expenses needed to travel to medical care. Certain items are conditionally eligible, such as wigs _if_ your disease or treatment has caused hair loss. A letter of medical necessity from your doctor can greatly broaden the universe of eligible items.

Before 65 you cannot pay for insurance premiums with your HSA unless you're receiving unemployment benefits or using [COBRA](https://www.healthcare.gov/unemployed/cobra-coverage/), the federal program that allows you to keep your health insurance with a group plan after leaving a job by paying the full cost yourself. Once you turn 65, or enroll in Social Security or Medicare, you can no longer contribute to your HSA. But you can pay for most Medicare premiums with your HSA, as well as [long-term care insurance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ua7WMUSV1-A) premiums. If the investment approach were initiated early in life and maximized, you would contribute several hundred thousand dollars and have millions of dollars in the account by age 65. It is best used along with retirement accounts, which allow further tax-advantaged contributions each year and provide a source of last-resort funds that can be withdrawn with a lower 10% penalty. However, if your need for cash becomes dire and you’ve saved documentation of your medical expenses, you can withdraw HSA funds by reimbursing yourself for past medical expenses, then use that money for whatever else. This is worth underlining as one of the best features of your HSA: with ongoing medical expenses that build over time and have not been reimbursed, you have the freedom to withdraw and [reimburse yourself](https://www.hsaedge.com/2012/06/13/using-your-hsa-as-an-atm/) for those expenses at any time, penalty- and tax-free. Meanwhile, that money stays in your HSA and enjoys tax-free investment. You could also use reimbursement as a means of tax-free withdrawal for normal expenses after 65, if your HSA funds exceed health needs.

Not every American can contribute to an HSA every year. You're eligible to contribute only if you have a [high-deductible health plan (HDHP)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-deductible_health_plan). If you contribute to your HSA while you have an HDHP, then switch to a non-HDHP, you can still use your HSA to spend and invest. You can resume contributions if you switch back to an HDHP. It's beyond the scope of this guide to discuss the benefits and drawbacks of different plans for different people. I will simply say that people with a wide variety of medical expenses can find an HDHP to be suitable. The unique tax benefits of an HSA, even if not used for investing, make HDHPs a good fit for more people than they would be otherwise. Unfortunately, not all employers offer an HDHP. While it's always possible to pay for an individual insurance plan, group plans are less expensive, so it's likely that HSA contributions will not be feasible while working at such companies. You may want to take this into account when considering job offers, because it has real financial consequences. And if you're a taxpayer in [California or New Jersey](https://github.com/investindex/Taxes#hsas), it's important to be aware of the tax treatment of HSAs in those states.

#### 529 accounts, contribution limits, and charity

[529 accounts](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/1/529plan.asp) are used to pay for the educational expenses of a specific beneficiary, although the beneficiary can be changed. Contributions to a 529 account are not tax-deductible at the federal level, but some states provide deductions under certain conditions. They are still beneficial because investments grow tax-free and appropriate withdrawals used for education are not taxed. [US Treasury savings bonds](https://github.com/investindex/Risk#us-treasury-savings-bonds) are [exempt from tax](https://www.thebalance.com/how-to-use-savings-bonds-to-help-pay-for-college-2085509) if rolled into a 529 account within 60 days of redemption. You need to research the investment options available to you before contributing. An IRA or HSA can offer almost as much freedom as a standard brokerage account,<sup id="fn5">[[5]](#f5)</sup> but the options for your 401(k) or 529 may be less attractive. This is partly why [rolling over](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/ira-rollover.asp) your 401(k) into your IRA when you change employers is a good idea. You can also roll over while employed if your 401(k) provider allows "in-service" rollovers. You should consider carrying out a rollover at the first opportunity, because 401(k) providers [charge fees](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/personal-finance/061913/hidden-fees-401ks.asp) that will hamper your investment growth.

These drawbacks of 401(k) investing imply that once you've maxed out 401(k) employer matching, you should prioritize your IRA and potentially your HSA. Only if you have reached the limit of tax-deductible contributions to these accounts, and you want to contribute even more, should you return to your 401(k). Contribution limits for 401(k) accounts are far higher than those for IRAs, which is a major benefit for people with high income. In 2022, IRA contributions are limited to $6,000 (or $7,000 for those who are at least 50), whereas the 401(k) limit is $20,500 (or $27,000 for those who are at least 50). The 401(k) limit is only for employee contributions; the limit for the sum of employee and employer contributions is a whopping $61,000 (or $67,500 for those who are at least 50). HSA limits are $3,650 for single plans and $7,300 for family plans, with an additional $1,000 for those who are at least 55. Contributions to your 401(k), IRA, or HSA do not affect contribution limits in either of the other two types of accounts. You can contribute to both Roth and traditional accounts in the same year if you wish, but they have a joint limit. A 30-year-old who contributed $3K to their traditional IRA in 2022 has a remaining limit of $3K in their Roth IRA (and the 401(k) limit would be unaffected). IRA contributions are also limited by earned income. If someone earned a pre-tax total of $4K from their job in a given year, they could contribute no more than $4K (regardless of whether they realized capital gains, which are not earned income). Further limits are described [here](https://github.com/investindex/Taxes#tax-advantaged-accounts).

Finally, if charitable donations will be an important goal in your old age, traditional IRAs have a clear advantage over Roth IRAs. The untaxed contributions and investment earnings in your traditional IRA can be [donated tax-free](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/ira-charitable-rollover-provision-made-permanent-2015-12-25), whereas money in your Roth IRA has already been taxed and is ideally suited for personal spending. Your HSA is [poorly suited](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/what-are-the-rules-for-inheriting-an-hsa-2020-09-25) to charity as well as inheritance, so it's best used for personal spending after 65 if the amount exceeds anticipated health care spending. Your spouse can inherit your HSA with no tax paid — the funds are absorbed into their HSA — but any other personal beneficiary would have to pay tax on the full amount in the year of your death. If you donate to charity while you're alive using HSA funds, you still have to pay tax on those withdrawals. However, if the beneficiary of your HSA is a charity, there is no tax due when they receive the funds upon your death. Both traditional and Roth IRAs are better-suited to leave to children or other persons. None of these concerns should be a dominant influence on how much money you choose to spend or donate, but considering them will increase your wealth and the wealth of your beneficiaries.

There is additional, highly important information on tax-advantaged accounts in the [section on taxes](https://github.com/investindex/Taxes#tax-advantaged-accounts). For various examples of how judicious use of taxable, tax-deferred, and tax-exempt accounts during working and retirement years can enhance the longevity of your portfolio, see chapter 10 of Larry Swedroe's [book on retirement](https://libgen.rs/search.php?req=Swedroe+Grogan+Your+Complete+Guide+to+a+Successful+and+Secure+Retirement&open=0&res=25&view=simple&phrase=1&column=def).

## Summary

Don’t ignore the possibility of catastrophic loss — protect yourself. Consider paying debt before investing. Take pre-emptive action to prevent fraud and frequently check activity in your accounts. Money invested for the long term should be heavy on stocks. Use tax-advantaged accounts when you can, and consider exploiting the unique, under-appreciated advantages of HSAs. Max out employer matching even if you have debt, with awareness that if you change employers it is possible to lose some 401(k) matching due to your vesting schedule.

The benefits of HSAs are:
* A triple tax advantage: tax-free contributions, tax-free investment, and tax-free qualified distributions.
* HSA contributions uniquely avoid FICA tax when deposited through payroll deduction. Contributions to traditional IRAs and 401(k)s avoid only income tax; you still pay FICA tax on that income.
* The ability to spend on health care from your checking account (while getting credit card rewards if you use a credit card), and reimburse yourself from the HSA in the future. With enough reimbursible expenses incurred over time, your HSA becomes a tax-free investment account that you can [withdraw from if needed](https://www.hsaedge.com/2012/06/13/using-your-hsa-as-an-atm/) at any time, penalty- and tax-free.
* The ability to withdraw penalty-free for non-medical reasons after age 65 (like a traditional IRA), but having still avoided FICA tax on the front end. Investing in an HSA is strictly better than doing so in a traditional IRA unless (a) you withdraw the money prematurely, (b) you want to donate the money before death, (c) you plan to leave the money to a non-spousal person upon death, or (d) you live in [CA or NJ](https://github.com/investindex/Taxes#hsas).
* Qualified distributions include health care expenses for your spouse and dependents. During old age, qualified distributions include paying for long-term care insurance premiums and most Medicare premiums.

Footnotes:

<sup id="f1"> 1 </sup> To compare debt repayment to investing, we need to account for taxes that would be paid on the investment. Let's imagine that we're someone with a typical level of income for investors, so we're subject to a 24% marginal federal tax rate for ordinary income and a 15% federal tax rate for [long-term capital gains](https://github.com/investindex/Taxes). And let's say we live in a state that taxes both short- and long-term capital gains at 5%. So for short-term capital gains, we will be taxed at a rate of 29% (24% federal + 5% state), and for long-term capital gains, we will be taxed at a rate of 20% (15% federal + 5% state). We have two sources of debt: a student loan accruing interest at 5% [APY](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/apy.asp) and a home mortgage accruing interest at 3% APY. Payments on the 5% debt are equivalent to annualized short-term capital gains of .05/(1-.29) = 7.04%, and annualized long-term capital gains of .05/(1-.2) = 6.25%. Payments on the 3% debt are equivalent to annualized short-term capital gains of .03/(1-.29) = 4.23%, and annualized long-term capital gains of .03/(1-.2) = 3.75%. If we anticipate chiefly long-term capital gains from investing in stock funds, we can estimate that payments on the student loan are equivalent to a risk-free annualized return of 6.25%, and payments on the home mortgage are equivalent to a risk-free annualized return of 3.75%.

It would be sensible to recognize that the equivalent of a risk-free 6.25% annual return is a great deal, and to first pay off the student loan while making no more than minimum payments on the home mortgage. During this period we would not invest, or save large amounts of cash beyond an emergency fund. (The main exception would be contributing to tax-advantaged accounts with employer matching, as discussed in [this section](https://github.com/investindex/Guidelines#tax-advantaged-accounts).) After completely paying off the student loan, we could begin allocating money to a stock portfolio. Our expected return from the stock portfolio might be 8-10% annually before taxes, which is about 6.4-8.0% after taxes. This is significantly higher than the risk-free 3% gains from making extra payments on the home mortgage. A stock portfolio also has the benefit of liquidity, while the cash value of home equity is hard to access if it's needed. The amount of the student loan or the mortgage is not relevant to these considerations, although some people irrationally might want to [pay off smaller debts first](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNmFrw0kdfM). Ben Felix explains in [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKc01jo1qLw) why it often makes sense to pay off your mortgage instead of allocating a large fraction of your taxable portfolio to bonds. After paying off the mortgage, we could begin increasing the allocation to bonds in the taxable portfolio, so that it fits whatever level of risk we find appropriate.

Someone might challenge this and say I haven't covered all the possibilities. What if instead of paying debt or adding to a taxable brokerage account, we invest additional money in a tax-advantaged account? This eliminates the drawback of paying taxes on realized capital gains. Indeed, these calculations are worth going over, but tax-advantaged accounts carry penalties for unqualified withdrawals. People should exercise care and ensure they have a sizable emergency fund if they choose this alternative. If we were to lose our job and the ability to pay our debt from our paycheck, liquidating investments in a taxable brokerage account is much easier and less costly than doing so in a tax-advantaged account. The only penalty-free distributions from tax-advantaged accounts we can call on at any time are (1) withdrawal of contributions (but not earnings) from a Roth IRA (but not Roth 401(k)), and (2) reimbursement for previously paid bills from an HSA.

<sup id="f2"> 2 </sup> There are three main credit bureaus to which your credit-related information is reported: [Experian](https://www.experian.com), [Equifax](https://www.equifax.com), and [TransUnion](https://www.transunion.com). If you haven’t, you should create accounts with each and ensure that the credit information is accurate. Experian and Equifax have decent websites; TransUnion’s website is hellish and designed to extract money from you. TransUnion doesn't make it easy to learn this from their website, but the "TrueIdentity" feature is how you access information for free. Be aware that there are two proprietary algorithms for calculating credit scores: a FICO score and a VantageScore. The FICO score is predominant and it's the score you should be most concerned with; the VantageScore was created more recently and is not usually attended to by lenders. In addition, there are many variants of each score. Credit bureaus are also called credit reporting agencies (CRAs).

As explained [here](https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/what-know-about-credit-freezes-and-fraud-alerts), a credit freeze prevents anyone from opening new credit accounts in your name. Even if someone has obtained your Social Security number — which is [much easier](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Erp8IAUouus) than it should be — they cannot use it to open a new account when your credit is frozen. It has a protective effect that is analogous to locking your debit card. See the following links for freezing your credit at [Experian](https://www.experian.com/freeze/center.html), [Equifax](https://www.equifax.com/personal/credit-report-services/credit-freeze/), and [TransUnion](https://www.transunion.com/credit-freeze). The same pages are used for unfreezing your credit.

There are two other companies with which you should freeze your information. [ChexSystems](https://www.chexsystems.com) is a company used by most banks to screen applicants for checking and savings accounts. Freezing your credit at the credit bureaus will prevent others from opening new credit accounts in your name, whereas a freeze with ChexSystems will provide a significant obstacle against others trying to open a bank account in your name. The freeze webpage is [here](https://www.chexsystems.com/web/chexsystems/consumerdebit/page/securityfreeze/information). There is also a fourth, smaller credit bureau called [Innovis](https://www.innovis.com), and their credit freeze link is [here](https://www.innovis.com/personal/securityFreeze). They don't provide the same easy access to information that the big three do and the website is terrible, so it's not a website you'll visit often, but you should freeze your credit with Innovis as well. 

You need to unfreeze only when a party with whom you do _not_ have a pre-existing credit relationship needs to perform a hard or soft credit inquiry. This may happen when applying for an apartment or in the later stages of a job application, and of course it will happen when you're seeking a loan or a new credit card. Anytime you need to allow an inquiry, you can temporarily lift the freeze, unfreeze, or give them an access code that permits a single-use inquiry while your credit remains frozen. See [this link](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/identity_theft) for more information on those options. I don't suggest using weaker alternatives to freezing like fraud alerts. Even a credit freeze is [not perfect](https://krebsonsecurity.com/2021/04/experians-credit-freeze-security-is-still-a-joke/) given the somewhat lax security at the credit bureaus, but it is the best measure you can take.

Upon reading this you may again question how necessary it is. Why would someone steal _my_ identity? I’m no one special. I don’t have enemies. Let me emphasize that identity thieves don’t need to have ever encountered you personally. They may have [stolen your data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2017_Equifax_data_breach) from a credit bureau, a bank, an insurance company, a brokerage firm, an employer, a landlord, or one of the other parties to which you’ve supplied your precious Social Security number. Not having much money doesn’t make you an undesirable target; you may be _more_ desirable because you lack the resources to pursue identity thieves with expensive legal procedures. In response to the charge of paranoia, I will simply state again that pre-emptive action is less bothersome than a fraud investigation after some stranger has saddled you with thousands of dollars of debt in an account with your name on it.

A final note: the credit bureaus are for-profit businesses. They're even publicly listed: see [TRU](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/TRU), [EFX](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/EFX), [EXPN.L](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/EXPN.L). All three, and especially TransUnion, will try to get you to pay them. Products range from "credit lock" to programs that claim to help you boost your credit. I don't suggest paying them for anything; however appealing the products may sound, everything you need is available for free. If you feel inclined to take one of their credit card recommendations (for which they're paid), be sure to research the alternatives first. [↩](#fn2)

<sup id="f3"> 3 </sup> How many years exactly? A weasel word, _number_, is used because there is no perfect answer. The historical evidence suggests that a five-year horizon is sufficient in a large majority of cases, while an eight-year horizon is very safe and will permit you to wait for a recovery from nearly any potential downturn. In US history, only the [Great Depression](https://github.com/investindex/Risk#f6) would violate this rule. [↩](#fn3)

&nbsp;

<sup id="f4"> 4 </sup> The only exception is _employer_ contributions to a 401(k). Employee contributions are subject to FICA taxes. Even if your employer offers a Roth 401(k), employers do not contribute to your Roth 401(k). Employer contributions are made to your traditional account regardless of which plan you contribute to. [↩](#fn4)

&nbsp;

<sup id="f5"> 5 </sup> Money in tax-advantaged accounts cannot legally be traded on [margin](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/margin.asp), so IRAs and HSAs are still less capable than a taxable brokerage account. A feature called limited margin is allowed, which allows you to re-use funds immediately instead of being subject to a two-day [settlement period](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/settlement_period.asp), as is required in a cash account. By design, limited margin does not permit use of borrowed funds. [↩](#fn5)
