# Guidelines for financial planning

There is no perfect distribution of stocks, bonds, and other assets. This depends on many factors. Health, age, debt, income, job security, marriage status, children (or plans to have them), risk tolerance, and your personal goals — these are only some of them. The broad goal here is to provide tools to assess what investments fit your situation. However, a few financial guidelines discussed below can be applied broadly.

Mathematical details of [retirement planning](https://github.com/investindex/Guidelines#retirement-planning) are also described. Hopefully they illustrate the impressive power of compounding growth that can make comfortable retirement possible.

&nbsp;

## Minimize risk of catastrophic loss

First, avoid extreme investment risks. Investing can be most hazardous when using debt or [leverage](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/leverage.asp): using [margin](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/margin.asp) features in a brokerage account or loans to invest in real estate, for instance. Leverage is not always dangerous, but it puts you at greater risk of large losses. Any use of borrowed funds creates the possibility of losing more than you invested, replacing what was once an asset with unexpected debt. Although I wouldn’t discourage all uses of leverage — a home mortgage is a form of leverage — none of the investment options recommended here use it.

Second, _always_ have insurance for extremely valuable physical assets like your car and home, as well as health insurance. Even if your car has low value, liability coverage is vital for car insurance. Without it, you could find yourself paying the medical bills of someone you injured in a car accident. Understand the coverage you’re entitled to, so that you’re not subject to surprise denials. Once you’ve achieved some financial stability, seriously consider purchasing disability insurance. Almost everyone's most valuable asset is not something that comprises their current wealth — it is their capacity to earn income. Social Security disability payments are probably not enough to support you if you’re unable to continue earning income. You may be able to purchase disability insurance through your employer; this can be less expensive but it may not be tailored to your needs and usually lacks portability if you change employers. If anyone else depends on your future income, purchasing life insurance is a way to safeguard them. The most suitable type for nearly everyone is [term life insurance](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/termlife.asp) (instead of [whole life insurance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AgBhy8iXjpI&ab_channel=TwoCents) or [universal life insurance](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/205.asp)). Finally, your most basic financial priority should be to build or maintain an [emergency fund](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vftjBTjFlzI&ab_channel=TwoCents) after paying off credit card debt.

Many people don’t take these actions or, if their finances are chronically strained, are unable to. But be aware that if you neglect to protect yourself, there will be an ever-present risk of financial ruin. Insurance may seem like a waste of money when times are good, but never forget that unpredictable, unavoidable events can shatter your life in an instant. Nothing can bankrupt you faster than expensive tragedies like a health crisis without health insurance.

&nbsp;

## Debt and investment

Pay debt instead of holding bonds or cash, and pay high-interest debt instead of holding stocks. Someone with low-interest loans — let’s say less than 4% [APY](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/apy.asp) — should not invest in bonds or hold large amounts of cash. This [usually includes someone](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKc01jo1qLw&ab_channel=BenFelix) with a home mortgage. Someone paying high interest — a 7% student loan or a 16% credit card loan — should not invest in the stock market either. A tax-free and risk-free 7% annualized return is achieved by every payment on a 7% APY loan. This is preferable to the higher average return from stocks, because the latter carries far more risk and will be taxed. Of course, you should address debt with the highest interest rate first; for many people this is credit card debt. All super high-interest loans like these should be paid off before investing or even building savings. The exact interest rate thresholds depend on your risk tolerance and marginal tax rate. See this footnote<sup id="fn1">[1](#f1)</sup> for an example that works out the mathematics of comparing debt payments to investing.

One other consideration is important. If needed, money invested in stocks or bonds can be easily liquidated. In contrast, a drawback of paying debt is that the decision can’t be easily reversed. The money is paid back, and would need to be borrowed again if you had an unexpected need for it. However, paying debt can be a very attractive equivalent of investing, as the footnote illustrates.

## Financial security

Financial fraud is unfortunately a common occurrence. There are a number of simple actions and habits anyone can use to drastically lower the probability of being a victim of fraud.

Lock debit card. Use credit cards. If you're unable to be approved for a credit card right now, see the [personal finance subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/) for advice. It's a fantastic resource for all topics in personal finance, including fraud, building credit, managing debt, budgeting, and insurance.

Check your bank account and credit card accounts often, at least twice per week. Sign up for all possible alerts. I personally receive both an email and a mobile alert whenever there is a deposit to or withdrawal from my bank account, whenever a credit card is charged, and whenever personal information on file like my address is changed. If you have the patience, activate two-factor authentication so that you confirm all logins using your phone. This may seem tedious but it greatly enhances the security of your accounts.

Keep your electronic devices locked and don't share passwords with anyone unless you completely trust them. Most people do not consider how much of their information is vulnerable after simply bypassing the lock on their phone or computer. The perpetrators of fraud are often family members, and because most people would be reluctant to pursue criminal charges against a family member, they often have no recourse. High levels of security like two-factor authentication work only if you keep your devices secure.

Don't use the same password for Netflix and your bank account. You don't need to generate a different series of 20 random characters for every account in your life. But you'll naturally be less secretive about your Netflix password and it may seem like no big deal to share with a family member or friend. Keep passwords for your banking and brokerage activity utterly separate from others. Your email is how your other passwords can be reset, so ensure that your email password is also secure and separate from casual accounts.

Know who has access to your accounts, and which accounts. If you notice activity you can't explain, you need to know who to contact about this before reporting fraud. There are two important reasons: (1) you want to avoid false positives, in which you report fraudulent activity but soon find out that it was normal; and (2) you want to be able to report real fraud as soon as possible, so you should know who could be responsible for activity in your account. To reduce this potential confusion, minimize the number of accounts and cards to which anyone else has access, and be very careful about who is allowed access.

Don't fall into the trap of assuming that you're an unlikely target of fraud because there is not much money in your bank account. Testimonies on the personal finance subreddit show that it's all too common for people with less than $10,000 in their checking accounts to find that their money has been stolen. For example, people have found that thousands of dollars disappeared from their account due to multiple ATM withdrawals or debit card charges before they noticed. Following the advice above prevents this: lock your debit card, turn on activity alerts, and check your account often.

Consider keeping a categorized budget and recording all spending in a spreadsheet. The act of comparing your accounts against your recorded spending will keep you from overlooking small, dispersed fraud. Many people fail to notice these kinds of purchases because their account value is not strongly affected at any one time, and because they don't pay close attention to their account activity. It's easy to let a busy life get in the way of monitoring and securing your money — try not to let it. As we'll see below, recording your budget is also essential for planning your future, because you have to know how much you spend in order to know how much to save.

If a stranger sends you money using a service like Venmo or PayPal, and contacts you saying it was an accident, do not send the money back. This is a well-known scam.

If a company calls and says to call back at a particular number, don’t call that number. Check the company’s website for their official number, and call _that_ number. A common tactic by fraudsters is to represent themselves as a trusted party and ask you to call back at a number of their choosing. Never give anyone personal information, like your Social Security number, unless you contacted them and you’re sure you know who they are. Be extremely conscious of when you're supplying any sensitive information.

Grandmother scam. Perhaps alert relatives.

## Simplify your investments, don't simplify your thinking

Index funds are useful because they invest in a shifting collection of hundreds or thousands of securities, which would be an onerous task for anyone without access to institutional resources. They illustrate that simple solutions can be superior to complex solutions. There are expanding offerings for the ultimate simplification: all-in-one funds. They allow you to select a single fund based on allocation, such as 60% stocks and 40% bonds, and provide you with an automatically [rebalanced](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/rebalancing.asp), globally diversified assembly of stocks and bonds. There are all-in-one mutual funds from [Vanguard](https://investor.vanguard.com/mutual-funds/lifestrategy) and [Schwab](https://www.schwab.com/mutual-funds/mutual-fund-portfolio/market-track-portfolios), as well as all-in-one ETFs from BlackRock with allocations of [80/20](https://www.ishares.com/us/products/239729/ishares-aggressive-allocation-etf), [60/40](https://www.ishares.com/us/products/239756/ishares-growth-allocation-etf), [40/60](https://www.ishares.com/us/products/239765/ishares-moderate-allocation-etf), and [30/70](https://www.ishares.com/us/products/239733/ishares-conservative-allocation-etf). Although using one of these is far better than not investing, they carry a hazard.

When you decide how much money to save and invest, you should consider why you are investing: retirement or other long-term goals, college tuition, a vacation, a down payment on a car or house. Assigning purposes to various portions of your money forces you to consider which investments are appropriate for each portion. All-in-one funds, on the other hand, may cause someone to vaguely reflect on the level of risk they desire, without ever thinking through how they would distribute each portion to specific buckets like stocks, long-term bonds, and short-term bonds. If stocks crash, they may realize their stock allocation was too heavy; or if stocks have a brilliant run-up, they may wish they hadn't held so much in bonds. Whatever degree of complexity you choose, ensure that your allocation will produce an acceptable outcome regardless of how the stock market behaves in the near future. The only way to do this is through deliberate planning, not vague assessment of your risk tolerance.

I'll suggest the following outline depending on the time horizon for a given portion of someone's assets:
* 8+ years: stocks
* 4-8 years: stocks + high-yield bonds + high-quality, intermediate- and long-term bonds
* 2-4 years: high-yield bonds + (mostly) high-quality bonds
* Less than 2 years: high-quality, short-term bonds + cash/money market fund

As addressed in the next topic, this is a very general proposal and, as vague as it is, it is still not appropriate for everyone. Someone may also want to consider the maximium drawdown they're willing to tolerate.

Target retirement funds are another type of all-in-one fund. They increase bond allocation over time as investors gradually approach a given retirement year (e.g., [Vanguard Target Retirement Fund 2040](https://investor.vanguard.com/mutual-funds/profile/VFORX)). These are great as a default investment in 401(k) accounts, but I don't encourage them for people who are willing to devote any time to this. Deciding on a stock/bond allocation is a task most people can handle, especially those willing to read a guide like this. Allowing a default [glide path](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/glide-path.asp) to dictate your asset allocation is often not in your best interest. Moreover, be aware that target retirement funds are [not always sensitive](https://www.wsj.com/articles/vanguard-target-retirement-tax-bill-surprise-11642781228) to those using the fund in a taxable account. They may have large capital gains distributions to which their tax-advantaged 401(k) investors are indifferent.

&nbsp;

## Allocation and time horizon

People with higher net worth relative to their financial needs have longer time horizons, and benefit from allocating more heavily to stocks. This can be illustrated with an extreme case. A person with $4 million in liquid net worth could withdraw [about 2.5% each year](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BScK-QyWIo&ab_channel=BenFelix) — $100,000 in the first year before taxes — and live on these withdrawals indefinitely by holding a 100% stock portfolio. Not only would this person not deplete their assets, but because the withdrawals are conservative, the value of their investments would grow over the long run in virtually any plausible future stock market. Hopefully it is clear that for this person, seeking the supposed safety of bonds would encumber the long-term growth of their portfolio and make depletion of their assets _more_ likely.

For the majority of Americans who are not multimillionaires, how can this principle be applied? If there is a portion of your savings you are reserving for the future and don’t plan to use for a number of years,<sup id="fn2">[2](#f2)</sup> on average you will benefit most by investing it in 100% stocks. (This does not imply that your stock allocation should be limited to long-term reserves.) For many people this description applies readily to a tax-advantaged retirement account. If you will not need to draw on your retirement funds in the next eight years, your retirement portfolio will have the strongest expected growth with 100% stocks. Any inclusion of bonds will attenuate its long-term value. For some this statement will seem obvious, but it is a widespread practice to include bonds in long-term retirement portfolios. The justification often does not seem to be that part of the money needs to be secure for potential premature access, but that the volatility of a 100% stock portfolio is emotionally uncomfortable.

&nbsp;

## Tax-advantaged accounts

Most tax-advantaged retirement accounts are either an [IRA](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/ira.asp) (individual retirement account) or an employer-sponsored [401(k)](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/1/401kplan.asp) account. They incentivize retirement planning by offering the opportunity to save a great deal on taxes if you set aside the money until old age. There are two ways to implement this, and an individual can use one or both. With a [traditional](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/traditionalira.asp) plan, no income tax is paid on contributions or investment earnings, but withdrawals are taxed as ordinary income. With a [Roth](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/rothira.asp) plan, contributions are taxed like the rest of your income, but earnings and [appropriate withdrawals](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/q/qualifieddistribution.asp) are tax-free. Withdrawals are meant to be delayed until age 59½, so early withdrawals are hit with a 10% penalty on top of triggering any tax owed. You're exempt from penalty if you meet [uncommon criteria](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/q/qualifieddistribution.asp) or you're withdrawing only contributions (but not earnings) from a Roth account. The advantages of a traditional or Roth plan depend mainly on whether you expect your marginal tax rate during retirement to be higher or lower than the marginal tax rate in the year you’re contributing. A year with low income suggests the Roth plan.<sup id="fn3">[3](#f3)</sup> You should take advantage of employer matching every year in your IRA or 401(k) — even if you have high-interest debt. If there is a 50% matching policy, you will earn a risk-free, tax-deferred 50% return simply by contributing up to a certain limit. Even if you later need to withdraw the money prematurely with a 10% penalty, employer matching is not an opportunity you want to miss.

The only exception to this is if you plan to leave your company soon, and your matching contributions to a 401(k) [will not vest immediately](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/081815/can-my-company-ever-be-entitled-take-my-401k.asp). What does this mean? To incentivize retention, your employer may require a certain period of working years until your matching contributions belong to you completely. That is, until you are 100% vested, some or all of your matching contributions may be revoked if you leave. Vesting may increase by 20 percentage points each year, for example, but the schedule is up to the employer except for the legal requirement that it must reach 100% after six years. Once you are 100% vested after six years at most, all prior and future matching contributions are immediately and permanently assured regardless of when you leave the company. Once you have maxed out employer matching in a given year, you can continue tax-deductible contributions up to a limit, or contribute to another tax-advantaged account like a [health savings account (HSA)](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/hsa.asp) or [529 account](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/1/529plan.asp). These two additional account types provide tax advantages while allowing you to use the money for their designated purposes at any time — you don’t have to wait for old age.

#### Health savings accounts

HSAs are especially helpful: contributions are tax-deductible up to a limit, investments grow tax-free, and withdrawals used for qualifying medical expenses are not taxed. The account can pay for your own medical expenses as well as those of your spouse and dependents. You can reimburse yourself for previous medical expenses regardless of how long ago they were paid, as long as you can document the payments and the HSA was open when the expenses were incurred. Unlike your IRA or 401(k), your HSA even [escapes](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/09/18/this-triple-tax-advantaged-account-might-beat-your-401k-plan.html) FICA taxes, which fund Social Security and Medicare, as long as you contribute through your employer’s payroll deduction. For most people, FICA taxes amount to 7.65% of every dollar of income. Your employer may offer matching in your HSA because this enables them to pay you while escaping their share of FICA taxes too. HSAs do have a drawback: if you desperately need the money and withdraw it for non-medical reasons before age 65, you’ll pay a penalty of 20% — twice as high as in retirement accounts — in addition to income taxes. From a retirement perspective, you can use your HSA purely as an investment vehicle. After age 65, you can use it for medical expenses as you would have before, but the 20% penalty if you withdraw for other reasons will be gone. The withdrawals for non-medical reasons will be subject to tax, but so would withdrawals from a traditional IRA or 401(k).

If you commit to [an investment approach](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/personal-finance/091615/how-use-your-hsa-retirement.asp), you should max out HSA contributions every year and refrain from spending any of your HSA funds before 65, so that they appreciate maximally. You would pay for medical expenses before 65 with your checking account, not your HSA. This is a little counterintuitive, but it would allow your untaxed HSA contributions to spiral upward with tax-free capital gains, and much of the money would be withdrawn tax-free as well. As you age during retirement, you will probably spend [far more](https://www.soa.org/resources/research-reports/2013/research-health-care-birth-death/) on medical expenses than when you were younger, and maximizing your HSA would mean you’re able to fund those [large expenses](https://newsroom.fidelity.com/press-releases/news-details/2021/Fidelitys-20th-Annual-Retiree-Health-Care-Cost-Estimate-Hits-New-High-A-Couple-Retiring-Today-Will-Need-300000-to-Cover-Medical-Expenses-an-88-Increase-Since-2002/default.aspx) with invested money that has never been taxed.

Before 65 you cannot pay for insurance premiums with your HSA unless you're receiving unemployment benefits or using [COBRA](https://www.healthcare.gov/unemployed/cobra-coverage/), the federal program that allows you to keep your health insurance with a group plan after leaving a job by paying the full cost yourself. Once you turn 65, or enroll in Social Security or Medicare, you can no longer contribute to your HSA. But you can pay for most Medicare premiums with your HSA, as well as [long-term care insurance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ua7WMUSV1-A&ab_channel=RetirementRevealed) premiums. If the investment approach were initiated early in life, you would contribute several hundred thousand dollars and have millions of dollars in the account by age 65. It is best used along with retirement accounts, which allow further tax-advantaged contributions each year and provide a source of last-resort funds that can be withdrawn with a lower 10% penalty. However, if your need for cash becomes dire and you’ve saved documentation of your medical expenses, you can withdraw HSA funds tax-free with no penalty by [reimbursing yourself](https://www.hsaedge.com/2012/06/13/using-your-hsa-as-an-atm/) for past medical expenses, then use that money for whatever else. You could also use reimbursement as a means of tax-free withdrawal for normal expenses after 65, if your HSA funds exceed health needs.

#### 529 accounts, charity, and more

Contributions to a 529 account are not tax-deductible at the federal level, but some states provide deductions under certain conditions. They are still beneficial because investments grow tax-free and appropriate withdrawals used for education are not taxed. But you need to research the investment options available to you before contributing. An IRA or HSA can offer almost as much freedom as a standard brokerage account,<sup id="fn4">[4](#f4)</sup> but the options for your 401(k) or 529 may be less attractive. See the options you have for a [Vanguard 529 account](https://investor.vanguard.com/529-plan/list#/529-plan), for example. This is partly why [rolling over](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/ira-rollover.asp) your 401(k) into your IRA when you change employers is a good idea. You can also roll over while employed if your 401(k) provider allows "in-service" rollovers. You should consider carrying out a rollover at the first opportunity, because 401(k) providers [charge fees](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/personal-finance/061913/hidden-fees-401ks.asp) that will hamper your investment growth. These drawbacks of 401(k) investing imply that once you've maxed out 401(k) employer matching, you should prioritize your IRA and potentially your HSA. Only if you have reached the limit of tax-deductible contributions to these accounts, and you want to contribute even more, should you return to your 401(k). Contribution limits for 401(k) accounts are far higher than those for IRAs, which is a major benefit for people with high income. In 2022, IRA contributions are limited to $6,000 (or $7,000 for those who are at least 55), whereas the 401(k) limit is $20,500 (or $27,000 for those who are at least 50).

Finally, if charitable donations will be an important goal in your old age, traditional IRAs have a clear advantage over Roth IRAs. The untaxed contributions and investment earnings in your traditional IRA can be [donated tax-free](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/ira-charitable-rollover-provision-made-permanent-2015-12-25), whereas money in your Roth IRA has already been taxed and is ideally suited for personal spending. Your HSA is [poorly suited](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/what-are-the-rules-for-inheriting-an-hsa-2020-09-25) to charity as well as inheritance, so it's best used for personal spending after 65 if the amount exceeds anticipated health care spending. If you donate to charity using HSA funds, you still have to pay tax on those withdrawals. Your spouse can inherit your HSA with no tax paid — the funds are absorbed into their HSA — but any other beneficiary, including a charity, would have to pay tax on the full amount in the year of your death. Both traditional and Roth IRAs are better-suited to leave to children or others. None of these concerns should be a dominant influence on how much money you choose to spend or donate, but considering them will increase your wealth and the wealth of your beneficiaries.

For various examples of how judicious use of taxable, tax-deferred, and tax-exempt accounts during working and retirement years can enhance the longevity of your portfolio, see chapter 10 of Larry Swedroe's [book on retirement](https://libgen.is/search.php?req=Swedroe+Grogan+Your+Complete+Guide+to+a+Successful+and+Secure+Retirement&open=0&res=25&view=simple&phrase=1&column=def).

&nbsp;

## Summary

Don’t ignore the possibility of catastrophic loss — protect yourself. Consider paying debt before investing. Money invested for the long term should be heavy on stocks. Use tax-advantaged accounts when you can, and consider exploiting the unique, under-appreciated advantages of HSAs. Max out employer matching even if you have debt, with awareness that if you change employers it is possible to lose some 401(k) matching due to your vesting schedule.

## Retirement planning

Let's start with a broad overview of how to think about preparing for long-run investing and retirement.

Factors over which you exercise some control include:  
-Income during your working years and changes in income over time;  
-Allocation and timing of investments;  
-Use of [tax-advantaged accounts](https://github.com/investindex/Guidelines#tax-advantaged-accounts);  
-At what age you may merge finances with a long-term partner;  
-At what age you may have children;  
-Support you expect to provide to and receive from your family;  
-How much you will spend, save, and invest during working years;  
-How much you will change your spending after retirement;  
-How you will change your investment approach after retirement;  
-Age of retirement;  
-Whether you retire suddenly or continue earning a smaller income for some time;  
-Personal goals such as charitable donations or leaving money for your children.

Factors over which you exercise little or no control include:  
-[Asset class](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/assetclasses.asp) returns for stocks and bonds;  
-Inflation rates;  
-Interest rates;  
-Tax rates;  
-Government benefits like Social Security, which may change by the time you retire.

The daunting scope of retirement planning may provoke some people who haven't thought much about the arc of their life plan to start to consider some important questions. What do you value about money and what do you want to do with it? How much is enough? How much time and how many years do you want to spend working for pay? After approaching financial independence, is there something you would enjoy doing that pays less or nothing at all? 

Although there are variables you cannot control, like federal tax rates, you can adjust variables which are under your control, like savings rates, to make it more likely that you’ll be prepared for an uncertain future. There are also factors which are under your control to a great degree, except in rare situations. Health is a perfect example: most people have the opportunity to reduce expected health care costs by keeping themselves healthy, but it is always possible to be dealt an unavoidable illness or injury. As discussed above, this falls in the category of potentially catastrophic risks you can insure yourself against.

Many of these variables can be entered into an online retirement calculator like [this one](https://www.bankrate.com/retirement/calculators/retirement-plan-calculator/). Basic calculators give you an idea of how your saving and investing will add up in the long run, and whether they can sustain you during retirement. There are many factors that can't be explicitly included in these calculators, like unexpected support you may need to provide to children or aging parents in middle age, and potentially [very high](https://newsroom.fidelity.com/press-releases/news-details/2021/Fidelitys-20th-Annual-Retiree-Health-Care-Cost-Estimate-Hits-New-High-A-Couple-Retiring-Today-Will-Need-300000-to-Cover-Medical-Expenses-an-88-Increase-Since-2002/default.aspx) medical costs in old age. These calculations are inevitably based on rough assumptions. But working out imprecise numbers is far better than the vague assumptions that would take their place. Planning your future will also demonstrate how useful it is to keep track of your spending. Exactly how much do you spend on food? How much does car maintenance cost? You will be able to project future spending far more accurately if you record and categorize your current spending. You may also be able to target areas in which you’re spending more than you thought.

I don't recommend relying on calculators like the one above (or rules of thumb like [this](https://www.fidelity.com/viewpoints/retirement/how-much-do-i-need-to-retire)). Some of the math needed for retirement planning is more advanced than many people are used to, but it's important to understand the assumptions behind the numbers that guide your saving and investing. So we'll review the calculations needed for retirement planning in detail.

### Les mathématiques

We can begin with a simple matter of computing average return. If over three years our investments provide annual returns of 7%, 15.5%, and -2%, what is the average annual return? We must convert these percentage changes to multipliers: 1.07, 1.155, and .98. The geometric mean is calculated as (1.07×1.155×.98)^(1/3) = 1.0659, a 6.59% average annual return. See this footnote for why it must be calculated that way.<sup id="fn5">[5](#f5)</sup>

Second, how does [inflation](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/inflation.asp) work when calculating returns? We can calculate growth over time based on an anticipated average rate of return. If we assume a 9% average annual return over 40 years, the asset will be multiplied by 1.09^40 = 31.4. This is our nominal return, which is distinguished from the real return — that which remains after accounting for inflation. With average 2.5% inflation, it is calculated as 1.09/1.025 = 1.0634, or a 6.34% real return. This gives us a real multiplier over 40 years of (1.09/1.025)^40 = 11.7. So instead of imagining that your money will multiply by 31.4, remember that your dollars will be worth less in 40 years, and the multiplier will feel much more like 11.7. If this shrinking multiplier is discouraging, imagine how your dollars would decay if you didn't invest at all: (1/1.025)^40 = .372. They would lose 63% of their purchasing power over 40 years! A 9% nominal return converts that multiplier of .37 to 11.7.

Finally, how can we find the savings needed to spend a given amount during retirement, while accounting for inflation and investment earnings? Let's imagine that we want an annual "income" of $60,000 in today's dollars by drawing from our investments and receiving Social Security payments. The $60K accounts not only for discretionary spending, but also for increased health care costs and other potentially large expenses in old age. Keep in mind that this is for an individual — a married couple would need to spend more, but probably not twice as much. We've used the government's [calculator](https://www.ssa.gov/benefits/retirement/estimator.html) and estimated that our middle-class income will entitle us to about $15K per year from Social Security. We'll rely on our investments for the remaining $45K. These amounts are expressed in today's dollars, because that's what we can relate to — $161K of inflated dollars 40 years in the future is not intuitive. We decide that we'll commit to withdrawing an average of 3.5% of the nest egg per year, reducing withdrawals slightly when our investments drop in value and potentially increasing them when our investments perform very well. An average 3.5% withdrawal of $45K translates to a nest egg of 45,000×(100/3.5) = 1,285,714. Assuming 2.5% average inflation for 40 years, $1.29M in today's dollars would be multiplied by 1.025^40 to give $3.37M. That's the actual dollar amount we're aiming for in 40 years to provide a standard of living similar to $45K/year today. How can we reach it?

There are many ways of doing so. We'll describe the simplest first. We save and invest $7,167 the first year, and every year we increase that amount by our anticipated average inflation rate, 2.5%. So in the second year we save $7,346, and so on until we save $18,774 in the 40th year (calculated as 7,166.97×1.025^39). If our nominal returns are 9% as expected, then we'll have saved [$483,072](https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=Sum%5B7166.97*1.025%5EY%2C+%7BY%2C+0%2C+39%7D%5D) and built a nest egg of $3.37M by the end of the 40th year. See this footnote<sup id="fn6">[6](#f6)</sup> for how to calculate the first year's target using this approach as well as the next one. You can do so easily by changing the variables in a [formula](https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=ReplaceAll%5B%28D%2F%28W*R%5ET%29-A%29+%2F+Sum%5B%28G%2FR%29%5EY%2C+%7BY%2C+0%2C+T-1%7D%5D%2C+%7BR+-%3E+1.09%2F1.025%2C+G+-%3E+1%2C+T+-%3E+40%2C+D+-%3E+45000%2C+W+-%3E+.035%2C+A+-%3E+0%7D%5D) I typed into WolframAlpha. 

A variation on the first approach is to increase savings each year by last year's inflation, rather than an assumed long-term average inflation rate like 2.5%. This is a good idea, but of course when planning you will find yourself doing the same calculations because you cannot know what each year's inflation will be. If a given year has unusually low inflation, you may want to adhere to your assumed long-term rate anyway, to be safe.

This first approach could be called time-invariant or flat: you contribute the same inflation-adjusted amount every year. This is advantageous because the more you frontload your retirement savings, the less you need to save overall. In the example above, we contributed only 14% of the final nest egg and investment took care of the rest. In other words, six out of every seven dollars were the fruits of investing! If you could put away even more in your early life than this approach would suggest, that would be great. But many people need to do the opposite: they cannot save much until later in life. So we could design an approach in which we increase savings each year in addition to inflation, to acknowledge the growth in ability to save.

Imagine the same conditions as described above, but we increase savings each year by 2% on top of 2.5% for inflation. Our target savings in the first year will be only $5,531, a 23% reduction from the flat approach above. In the second year we save $5,531×1.02×1.025 = $5,783. In the 40th year we need to save $31,366, a 67% increase compared to the first example (calculated as 5,531.23(1.02×1.025)^39). Investment still does most of the work for us: we save less than 18% of the $3.37M. But it turns out to be a lot more in absolute terms: we had to put away [$599,163](https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=Sum%5B5531.23%281.02*1.025%29%5EY%2C+%7BY%2C+0%2C+39%7D%5D) using this approach, an increase of $116,000 or about 24%. We worked harder to build the same wealth in this example, but it is a more realistic model for many people. An interesting twist for people who can frontload their savings would be to _decrease_ inflation-adjusted savings each year. For example, someone who frontloads so that each year's inflation-adjusted decrease precisely counteracts their 2.5% increase for inflation would need to save only [$9,374](https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=ReplaceAll%5B%28D%2F%28W*R%5ET%29-A%29+%2F+Sum%5B%28G%2FR%29%5EY%2C+%7BY%2C+0%2C+T-1%7D%5D%2C+%7BR+-%3E+1.09%2F1.025%2C+G+-%3E+1%2F1.025%2C+T+-%3E+40%2C+D+-%3E+45000%2C+W+-%3E+.035%2C+A+-%3E+0%7D%5D) each year, for all 40 years! The total savings needed to reach the $3.37M goal would be only [$374,944](https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=Sum%5B9373.61%281%2F1.025*1.025%29%5EY%2C+%7BY%2C+0%2C+39%7D%5D) (11% of the total).

You may find it useful to reverse this process and convert certain savings patterns into retirement income. This footnote<sup id="fn7">[7](#f7)</sup> explains how to use the WolframAlpha calculator [here](https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=ReplaceAll%5BW*R%5ET*%28A%2BS*Sum%5B%28G%2FR%29%5EY%2C+%7BY%2C+0%2C+T-1%7D%5D%29%2C+%7BS+-%3E+5531.23%2C+G+-%3E+1.02%2C+R+-%3E+1.09%2F1.025%2C+T+-%3E+40%2C+W+-%3E+.035%2C+A+-%3E+0%7D%5D). Anyone interested in how the equation is derived can click [here](https://github.com/investindex/Guidelines/blob/main/Retirement.pdf).

We can use the first method to illustrate how important it is to start early. Our first year savings target is $7,167 if we have a 40-year horizon, but with 30 years the figure is $14,398; with 20 years it is $31,680; and with 10 years it is $90,267. If someone started very early in life and had 50 years until retirement, their first savings target would be a mere $3,716. When you start late, you give your capital less time to appreciate. In addition, allowing yourself more time implies that your average return will tend to revert to long-term expected returns. The average return of someone with a timeline of only 10 or 15 years will be strongly influenced by idiosyncratic trends and events; their results may be fantastic or underwhelming. For example, someone investing in the cap-weighted US market only from 2000-2009 would have been disappointed, whereas someone investing only from 2010-2019 would have experienced a dazzling run-up. The average return of someone with a timeline of 30 or 40 years is more predictable, in the neighborhood of [8% for the stock market](https://github.com/investindex/Risk#f1). We will discuss in the [next section](https://github.com/investindex/Portfolio) how to improve expected returns through diversification beyond the cap-weighted total market.

The assumptions of the examples above are open to question: someone might object that a 3.5% average withdrawal rate is overly conservative, or that 2.5% anticipated inflation is not conservative enough. Indeed, a 3.5% withdrawal rate is conservative and, as long as you allocate mostly to stocks, means that your assets are likely to grow over time despite withdrawals. Withdrawals as high as 5% in early retirement may be considered. See [these](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z7rH7h7ljHg&ab_channel=BenFelix) [videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BScK-QyWIo&ab_channel=BenFelix) on safe withdrawal rates. And indeed, you should calculate what your retirement plan looks like in a future with poor returns and high inflation. Imagine 7.5% nominal stock market returns and 3.5% inflation, yielding a real annual return of 3.86% (1.075/1.035 = 1.0386). The 40-year real multiplier drops from 11.7 in our example above to only 4.6. This is a very pessimistic projection, but it is important to test the limits of your retirement planning with unlikely yet possible futures like these.

&nbsp;

There are a few notes to keep in mind.

<b>(1)</b> Annual savings targets like $7,167 don't all come from your paycheck. Employer matching in your 401(k) might account for several hundred to some thousands of dollars, depending on your income. Once you add your own contributions, this minimum 401(k) activity can put a large dent in the savings you need.

<b>(2)</b> It is hard to predict the spending levels you'll desire decades in advance, as well as the funds you'll need to set aside for health care and beneficiaries. One reminder may be comforting. Because you no longer need to save money once you've retired, the "income" you require from investments and Social Security for a particular standard of living is inherently lower than the income needed during working years. If a 68-year-old retires and was making $75K/year while saving $25K/year for retirement, they need only $50K/year to support the same lifestyle (in fact, slightly less due to taxes). Many retirement experts find that overall retirement spending tends to be around 70-80% of pre-retirement spending.

<b>(3)</b> Many people cannot psychologically tolerate the volatility of a 100% stock portfolio, even in a retirement account they won't touch for 20 years. If you choose to include bonds in your portfolio, projections for its long-term growth must be lowered accordingly. Of course, as you approach within eight or ten years of retirement, it's a good idea to begin adding bonds to the portfolio. The goal might be a 60/40 allocation by retirement, so someone could convert 5% of the portfolio to bonds each year for eight years. But a sensible composition depends on many factors, and 60/40 is not appropriate for everyone. The lower expected returns due to this transition were not considered in the simple examples above, but they could be accounted for by doing calculations for multiple periods.

<b>(4)</b> Taxes are an essential part of retirement planning. When investing in a taxable account, take advantage of tax rates for [long-term capital gains](https://github.com/investindex/Taxes) as often as possible. If your taxable investing returns 10% annually and you pay 15% on the gains, your actual returns were 8.5%. Your projections have to account for this. Set aside as much as possible in tax-advantaged accounts, because the investment earnings will not be undercut by taxation during your working years. At the same time, remember that money in your traditional IRA is pre-tax, so using withdrawals from a traditional IRA to generate a $45K "income" is very different than doing the same with a Roth IRA. In the process of deciding on the income and nest egg size you want, you need to estimate how much you plan to contribute to (and withdraw from) Roth and traditional accounts. The order in which you withdraw from different accounts can also matter, because people don't tend to spend uniformly throughout retirement. The [retirement smile](https://retirementresearcher.com/retirement-spending-smile) describes the tendency for spending to slowly decline, and then rise in very old age. It matters if you withdraw variable amounts in different years because the total amount you pay in tax will be affected. Accounting for all this is not easy, and there's no expectation that anyone will do it with precision. But awareness of these factors is better than ignorance.

<b>(5)</b> During retirement, investments are highly subject to [sequence risk](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/retirement/sequence-of-returns-risk/), whereby poor returns are more harmful to a portfolio if they occur early rather than after some period of positive returns.<sup id="fn8">[8](#f8)</sup> If depleting your assets is a concern, then flexible spending during retirement is important. In particular, reducing withdrawals when stocks have fallen enhances the longevity of your assets. A large allocation to bonds early in retirement is one way to defend against sequence risk. Another is to continue earning income for some time. Even 10% or 15% of your pre-retirement income made doing something you enjoy augments the compounding of your investments because it reduces your need to withdraw from them. I recommend this [interview with Michael Kitces](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5dbPdCdFRrs&ab_channel=TheRationalReminderPodcast) on a variety of retirement topics, including sequence risk and approaches to spending.

Footnotes:

<sup id="f1"> 1 </sup> To compare debt repayment to investing, we need to account for taxes that would be paid on the investment. Let's imagine that we're someone with a typical level of income for investors, so we're subject to a 24% marginal federal tax rate for ordinary income and a 15% federal tax rate for [long-term capital gains](https://github.com/investindex/Taxes). And let's say we live in a state that taxes both short- and long-term capital gains at 5%. So for short-term capital gains, we will be taxed at a rate of 29% (24% federal + 5% state), and for long-term capital gains, we will be taxed at a rate of 20% (15% federal + 5% state). We have two sources of debt: a student loan accruing interest at 5% [APY](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/apy.asp) and a home mortgage accruing interest at 3% APY. Payments on the 5% debt are equivalent to annualized short-term capital gains of .05/(1-.29) = 7.04%, and annualized long-term capital gains of .05/(1-.2) = 6.25%. Payments on the 3% debt are equivalent to annualized short-term capital gains of .03/(1-.29) = 4.23%, and annualized long-term capital gains of .03/(1-.2) = 3.75%. If we anticipate chiefly long-term capital gains from investing in stock funds, we can estimate that payments on the student loan are equivalent to a risk-free annualized return of 6.25%, and payments on the home mortgage are equivalent to a risk-free annualized return of 3.75%.

It would be sensible to recognize that the equivalent of a risk-free 6.25% annual return is a great deal, and to first pay off the student loan while making no more than minimum payments on the home mortgage. During this period we would not invest, or save large amounts of cash beyond an emergency fund. (The main exception would be contributing to tax-advantaged accounts with employer matching, as discussed in [this section](https://github.com/investindex/Guidelines#tax-advantaged-accounts).) After completely paying off the student loan, we could begin allocating money to a stock portfolio. Our expected return from the stock portfolio might be 8-10% annually before taxes, which is about 6.4-8.0% after taxes. This is significantly higher than the risk-free 3% gains from making extra payments on the home mortgage. A stock portfolio also has the benefit of liquidity, while the cash value of home equity is hard to access if it's needed. The amount of the student loan or the mortgage is not relevant to these considerations, although some people irrationally might want to [pay off smaller debts first](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNmFrw0kdfM&ab_channel=PreetBanerjee). Ben Felix explains in [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKc01jo1qLw&ab_channel=BenFelix) why it often makes sense to pay off your mortgage instead of allocating a large fraction of your taxable portfolio to bonds. After paying off the mortgage, we could begin increasing the allocation to bonds in the taxable portfolio, so that it fits whatever level of risk we find appropriate. [↩](#fn1)

<sup id="f2"> 2 </sup> How many years exactly? A weasel word, _number_, is used because there is no perfect answer. The historical evidence suggests that a five-year horizon is sufficient in a large majority of cases, while an eight-year horizon is very safe and will permit you to wait for a recovery from nearly any potential downturn. In US history, only the [Great Depression](https://github.com/investindex/Risk#f5) would violate this rule. [↩](#fn2)

&nbsp;

<sup id="f3"> 3 </sup> Someone with a large traditional IRA could also [convert some money to their Roth IRA](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/iraconversion.asp) by paying taxes that year on the transferred money. If you have a six-figure income, you may exceed IRS limits for contributing to a Roth IRA, but you can still do so [through a backdoor](https://www.investopedia.com/how-to-set-up-a-backdoor-roth-ira-4584775). [↩](#fn3)

&nbsp;

<sup id="f4"> 4 </sup> Money in tax-advantaged accounts cannot legally be traded on [margin](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/margin.asp), so IRAs and HSAs are still less capable than a taxable brokerage account. A feature called limited margin is allowed, which allows you to re-use funds immediately instead of being subject to a two-day [settlement period](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/settlement_period.asp), as is required in a cash account. By design, limited margin does not permit use of borrowed funds. [↩](#fn4)

&nbsp;

<sup id="f5"> 5 </sup> For some people it may not be obvious why the more common arithmetic mean is unsuitable. Perhaps we could have found the average return like this: (7+15.5-2)/3 = 6.83 or (1.07+1.155+.98)/3 = 1.0683. To consider this, we can imagine an unlikely sequence of returns, in which we double our money the first year and halve it the following year. Multiplying an asset by 2 and then .5 returns it to its original value. We can calculate the geometric mean of these multipliers, which we know intuitively should be 1: (2×.5)^(1/2) = 1. That's right, but the arithmetic mean gives us an incorrect answer, (2+.5)/2 = 1.25. Another way of checking this is finding that the average return matches the actual return. 1.07×1.155×.98 = 1.21, which equals 1.0659^3. The arithmetic mean of 1.0683 does not satisfy this test. Because we are averaging multiplicative factors, the geometric mean must be applied. [↩](#fn5)

There are six variables. Five were already discussed: R for annual real return, T for years until retirement, D for desired retirement income in today's dollars, W for withdrawal rate, and G for inflation-adjusted annual growth of savings. G is introduced in the second approach to saving; to use the flat approach, set G equal to 1. The sixth variable is A, savings which already exist. The examples above assume no savings are set aside for retirement yet, but we can easily add this to the equation. R is the nominal return rate divided by inflation rate, 1.09/1.025 in the example above. To see how the equation is derived, [click here](https://github.com/investindex/Guidelines/blob/main/Retirement.pdf). [↩](#fn6)

<sup id="f7"> 7 </sup> The WolframAlpha calculator for calculating retirement income based on savings is [here](https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=ReplaceAll%5BW*R%5ET*%28A%2BS*Sum%5B%28G%2FR%29%5EY%2C+%7BY%2C+0%2C+T-1%7D%5D%29%2C+%7BS+-%3E+5531.23%2C+G+-%3E+1.02%2C+R+-%3E+1.09%2F1.025%2C+T+-%3E+40%2C+W+-%3E+.035%2C+A+-%3E+0%7D%5D). If a flat approach is desired, set G equal to 1 to effectively remove it. The variable S is the savings target in the first year. [↩](#fn7)

&nbsp;

<sup id="f8"> 8 </sup> An attentive reader might wonder if the same applies to building the nest egg during working years. One of the assumptions used in my calculations was not only that the average annual nominal return was 9%, but that the nominal return _every year_ was 9%. Yet there are unlimited combinations of annual returns whose average is 9%. Couldn't some of those combinations result in a nest egg that is significantly smaller or larger than the one I calculated? The short answer is, as long as the average ends up close to 9%, it's not a concern.

A longer answer: the best way to observe the range of possibilities would be to simulate many 40-year series of stock market returns. The issue is that we would have to decide on a distribution from which to draw random values, and there is no consensus on which distribution best fits stock market returns — the normal distribution certainly does not. But any plausible sequence of returns that has the same average annual return will produce a similar outcome. The crucial difference is that during retirement, you withdraw from the portfolio. If a retired person's portfolio experiences a large, protracted drawdown, then they need to withdraw a much larger fraction of their portfolio to maintain the same spending. Although the stock market recovers, the parts of the portfolio which were withdrawn never get a chance to recover. The accumulation phase faces no such challenge.

So while the idea that stock market returns will be the same every year is utterly unrealistic, it works as a mathematical assumption in the retirement calculator. Spending during retirement poses different problems. [↩](#fn8)

The WolframAlpha formula to calculate savings from desired retirement income is:

ReplaceAll[(D/(W\*R^T)-A) / Sum[(G/R)^Y, {Y, 0, T-1}], {R -> 1.09/1.025, G -> 1, T -> 40, D -> 45000, W -> .035, A -> 0}]

And to calculate retirement income from savings:

ReplaceAll[W\*R^T\*(A+S\*Sum[(G/R)^Y, {Y, 0, T-1}]), {S -> 5531.23, G -> 1.02, R -> 1.09/1.025, T -> 40, W -> .035, A -> 0}]
