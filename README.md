# Guidelines for financial planning

There is no perfect distribution of stocks, bonds, and other assets. This depends on many factors. Health, age, debt, income, job security, marriage status, children (or plans to have them), risk tolerance, and your personal goals — these are only some of them. The broad goal here is to provide tools to assess what investments fit your situation. However, a few guidelines discussed below can be applied broadly, and we'll also cover important personal finance topics not directly related to investing.

&nbsp;

## Minimize risk of catastrophic loss

First, avoid extreme investment risks. Investing can be most hazardous when using debt or [leverage](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/leverage.asp): using [margin](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/margin.asp) features in a brokerage account or loans to invest in real estate, for instance. Leverage is not always dangerous, but it puts you at greater risk of large losses. Any use of borrowed funds creates the possibility of losing more than you invested, replacing what was once an asset with unexpected debt. Although I wouldn’t discourage all uses of leverage — a home mortgage is a form of leverage — none of the investment options recommended here use it.

Second, _always_ have insurance for extremely valuable physical assets like your car and home, as well as health insurance. Even if your car has low value, liability coverage is vital for car insurance. Without it, you could find yourself paying the medical bills of someone you injured in a car accident. Understand the coverage you’re entitled to, so that you’re not subject to surprise denials. Once you’ve achieved some financial stability, seriously consider purchasing disability insurance. Almost everyone's most valuable asset is not something that comprises their current wealth — it is their capacity to earn income. Social Security disability payments are probably not enough to support you if you’re unable to continue earning income. You may be able to purchase disability insurance through your employer; this can be less expensive but it may not be tailored to your needs and usually lacks portability if you change employers. If anyone else depends on your future income, purchasing life insurance is a way to safeguard them. The most suitable type for nearly everyone is [term life insurance](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/termlife.asp) (instead of [whole life insurance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AgBhy8iXjpI&ab_channel=TwoCents) or [universal life insurance](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/205.asp)). Finally, your most basic financial priority should be to build or maintain an [emergency fund](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vftjBTjFlzI&ab_channel=TwoCents) after paying off credit card debt.

Many people don’t take these actions or, if their finances are chronically strained, are unable to. But be aware that if you neglect to protect yourself, there will be an ever-present risk of financial ruin. Insurance may seem like a waste of money when times are good, but never forget that unpredictable, unavoidable events can shatter your life in an instant. Nothing can bankrupt you faster than expensive tragedies like a health crisis without health insurance.

&nbsp;

## Debt and investment

Pay debt instead of holding bonds or cash, and pay high-interest debt instead of holding stocks. Someone with low-interest loans — let’s say less than 4% [APY](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/apy.asp) — should not invest in bonds or hold large amounts of cash. This [usually includes someone](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKc01jo1qLw&ab_channel=BenFelix) with a home mortgage. Someone paying high interest — a 7% student loan or a 16% credit card loan — should not invest in the stock market either. A tax-free and risk-free 7% annualized return is achieved by every payment on a 7% APY loan. This is preferable to the higher average return from stocks, because the latter carries far more risk and will be taxed. Of course, you should address debt with the highest interest rate first; for many people this is credit card debt. All super high-interest loans like these should be paid off before investing or even building savings. The exact interest rate thresholds depend on your risk tolerance and marginal tax rate. See this footnote<sup id="fn1">[1](#f1)</sup> for an example that works out the mathematics of comparing debt payments to investing.

One other consideration is important. If needed, money invested in stocks or bonds can be easily liquidated. In contrast, a drawback of paying debt is that the decision can’t be easily reversed. The money is paid back, and would need to be borrowed again if you had an unexpected need for it. However, paying debt can be a very attractive equivalent of investing, as the footnote illustrates.

&nbsp;

## Financial security and risk management

Financial fraud is unfortunately a common occurrence. There are a number of simple actions and habits anyone can use to drastically lower the probability of being a victim of fraud.

The fraud protection for credit cards is fundamentally [better](https://www.experian.com/blogs/ask-experian/are-credit-cards-safer-than-debit-cards/) than the protection for debit cards. When you use a debit card, you're spending your own money; when you use a credit card, you're spending the card issuer's money, which the card issuer is incentivized to protect. The best policy is to __lock your debit card__ with your bank's mobile app and temporarily unlock it only when you need it for ATM use. For spending, use credit cards exclusively. This will prevent any unauthorized use of your debit card or its information. If you're unable to be approved for a credit card right now, see the [personal finance subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/) for advice on building credit. It's a fantastic resource for all topics in personal finance (their guide to credit is [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/index#wiki_credit)). 

__Check your bank account__ and credit card accounts often, at least twice per week. Sign up for all possible alerts. I personally receive both an email and a mobile alert whenever there is a withdrawal from or deposit to my bank account, whenever a card is charged, and whenever personal information on file like my address is changed. I strongly encourage you to activate __two-factor authentication__ so that you confirm all logins using your phone or email. This may seem tedious but it greatly enhances the security of your accounts. Most phones now make the process seamless by autofilling with the number received over text. Adding two-factor authentication to your brokerage account has the added benefit of making it slightly less tempting to check your account value too often.

__Keep your electronic devices locked__ and don't share passwords with anyone unless you completely trust them. Most people do not consider how much of their information is vulnerable after simply bypassing the lock on their phone or computer. Perpetrators of fraud are sometimes family members, and because most people would be reluctant to pursue criminal charges against a family member, they may have no recourse. Features that provide a high level of security like two-factor authentication are only as secure as your devices.

In addition, ensure that your wallet and physical cards are in a known and safe location at all times. __Digital wallet services__ like Google Pay, Apple Pay, and Samsung Pay __are more secure__ than physical cards because a process called [tokenization](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-apple-pay-works-under-the-hood-8c3978238324/) means that your card information is never revealed to the merchant. This is true for online shopping as well, so use those services or others like PayPal during checkout when possible. Many ATMs allow you to use your debit card from your digital wallet, which is more secure because it protects you from [card](https://www.csoonline.com/article/3530302/credit-card-skimmers-explained-how-they-work-and-how-to-protect-yourself.html) [skimmers](https://review42.com/resources/credit-card-skimmer/). If possible, go inside your bank and do deposits and withdrawals with a teller. Not only is this more secure, it avoids ATM malfunctions which are [surprisingly common](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/search/?q=ATM&restrict_sr=1&sr_nsfw=). ATMs from both local credit unions and the largest banks sometimes just eat your cash.

Don't use the same password for Netflix and your bank account. You don't need to generate a different series of 20 random characters for every account in your life. But you'll naturally be less secretive about your Netflix password and it may seem like no big deal to share with a family member or friend. __Keep passwords for your banking and brokerage activity utterly separate from others.__ Your email is how other passwords can be reset, so ensure that your email password is also separate from casual accounts.

__Know who has access__ to your accounts, and which accounts. If you notice activity you can't explain, you need to know who to contact about this before reporting fraud. There are two important reasons: (1) you want to avoid false positives, in which you report fraudulent activity but soon find out that it was normal; and (2) you want to be able to report real fraud as soon as possible, so you should know who could be responsible for activity in your account. To reduce this potential confusion, minimize the number of accounts and cards to which anyone else has access, and be very careful about who is allowed access. Your accounts are only as secure as the weakest access point, and that access point could be the negligence of another person you've trusted with your account.

Don't fall into the trap of assuming that you're an unlikely target of fraud because there is not much money in your bank account. Testimonies on the personal finance subreddit show that it's all too common for people with less than $10,000 in their checking accounts to find that their money has been stolen. For example, people have found that thousands of dollars disappeared from their account due to multiple ATM withdrawals or debit card charges before they noticed. Following the advice above prevents this: lock your debit card, turn on activity alerts, and check your account often.

Consider keeping a __categorized budget__ and recording all spending in a spreadsheet. The act of comparing your accounts against your recorded spending will keep you from overlooking small, dispersed fraud. Many people [fail to notice](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/s55llt/update_someone_charged_my_wifes_card_132_times_on/) these kinds of purchases because their account value is not strongly affected at any one time, and because they don't pay close attention to their account activity. It's easy to let a busy life get in the way of keeping track of your money — try not to let it. Recording your budget is also important for planning your future, because you have to know how much you spend in order to know how much to save and invest.

If you conclude with confidence that someone has stolen your money or spent it fraudulently, and your bank is not forthcoming with reversals of the spending, it is best to file a police report. This quickly alerts your bank to the gravity of the situation. If your fraud claims are unsuccessful, you may also want to file a report with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and/or the FBI.

Scams are abundant, and while some are too obvious for anyone but your oldest relatives to fall for, others can be tricky. If a stranger sends you money with a service like Venmo or PayPal, and contacts you saying it was an accident, do not send the money back. This is a [well-documented scam](https://fraudpreventionunit.org/2021/07/21/watch-out-for-this-venmo-scam/).

If a company calls and asks you to call back at a particular number, don’t call that number. Check the company’s website for their official number, and call _that_ number. A common tactic by fraudsters is to represent themselves as a trusted party and ask you to call back at a number of their choosing. Or if you pick up, they will do the same, claiming to be Amazon or Verizon or Medicare and asking you to confirm some information. Never give anyone personal information, like your Social Security number, unless you contacted them and you’re sure you know who they are. Be extremely conscious when supplying any sensitive information, including a confirmation code that was texted or emailed to you. Caller ID can be faked and should never be trusted. The same goes for email addresses: an email will appear to be from Google, then when you check the specific address, you find that it was sent from \<myhr871@v7T3.ismn.us>. URLs that are highly similar to their legitimate counterparts can also be deceptive.

To some people, focusing on security to this degree may seem like overkill. I'll simply say that these measures would have appeared paranoid to many people who became preventable victims of fraud. Like insurance, security measures are not meant to feel convenient or make you happy. Hopefully imagining the feelings of regret and stress that accompany a fraud investigation will motivate you to take the steps described here _before_ anything bad happens. Reading posts on the [personal finance subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/) by people requesting advice after being defrauded may serve as additional motivation.

## Simplify your investments, don't simplify your thinking

Index funds are useful because they invest in a shifting collection of hundreds or thousands of securities, which would be an onerous task for anyone without access to institutional resources. They illustrate that simple solutions can be superior to complex solutions. There are expanding offerings for the ultimate simplification: all-in-one funds. They allow you to select a single fund based on allocation, such as 60% stocks and 40% bonds, and provide you with an automatically [rebalanced](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/rebalancing.asp), globally diversified assembly of stocks and bonds. There are all-in-one mutual funds from [Vanguard](https://investor.vanguard.com/mutual-funds/lifestrategy) and [Schwab](https://www.schwab.com/mutual-funds/mutual-fund-portfolio/market-track-portfolios), as well as all-in-one ETFs from BlackRock with allocations of [80/20](https://www.ishares.com/us/products/239729/ishares-aggressive-allocation-etf), [60/40](https://www.ishares.com/us/products/239756/ishares-growth-allocation-etf), [40/60](https://www.ishares.com/us/products/239765/ishares-moderate-allocation-etf), and [30/70](https://www.ishares.com/us/products/239733/ishares-conservative-allocation-etf). Although using one of these is far better than not investing, they carry a hazard.

When you decide how much money to save and invest, you should consider why you are investing: retirement or other long-term goals, college tuition, a vacation, a down payment on a car or house. Assigning purposes to various portions of your money forces you to consider which investments are appropriate for each portion. All-in-one funds, on the other hand, may cause someone to vaguely reflect on the level of risk they desire, without ever thinking through how they would distribute each portion to specific buckets like stocks, long-term bonds, and short-term bonds. If stocks crash, they may realize their stock allocation was too heavy; or if stocks have a brilliant run-up, they may wish they hadn't held so much in bonds. Whatever degree of complexity you choose, ensure that your allocation will produce an acceptable outcome regardless of how the stock market behaves in the near future. The only way to do this is through deliberate planning, not vague assessment of your risk tolerance.

I'll suggest the following outline depending on the time horizon for a given portion of someone's assets:
* 8+ years: stocks
* 4-8 years: stocks + high-yield bonds + high-quality, intermediate- and long-term bonds
* 2-4 years: high-yield bonds + (mostly) high-quality bonds
* Less than 2 years: high-quality, short-term bonds + cash/money market fund

As addressed in the next topic, this is a very general proposal and, as vague as it is, it is still not appropriate for everyone. Someone may also want to consider the maximium drawdown they're willing to tolerate. If they have savings assigned to uses in the next two years but they don't need every dollar, they may invest in an aggregate bond fund instead of a short-term bond fund, with awareness of the possibility that they will sell at a loss.

Target retirement funds are another type of all-in-one fund. They increase bond allocation over time as investors gradually approach a given retirement year (e.g., [Vanguard Target Retirement Fund 2040](https://investor.vanguard.com/mutual-funds/profile/VFORX)). These are great as a default investment in 401(k) accounts, but I don't encourage them for people who are willing to devote any time to this. Deciding on a stock/bond allocation is a task most people can handle, especially those willing to read a guide like this. Allowing a default [glide path](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/glide-path.asp) to dictate your asset allocation is often not in your best interest. Moreover, be aware that target retirement funds are [not always sensitive](https://www.wsj.com/articles/vanguard-target-retirement-tax-bill-surprise-11642781228) to those using the fund in a taxable account. They may have large capital gains distributions to which their tax-advantaged 401(k) investors are indifferent.

&nbsp;

## Allocation and time horizon

People with higher net worth relative to their financial needs have longer time horizons, and benefit from allocating more heavily to stocks. This can be illustrated with an extreme case. A person with $4 million in liquid net worth could withdraw [about 2.5% each year](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BScK-QyWIo&ab_channel=BenFelix) — $100,000 in the first year before taxes — and live on these withdrawals indefinitely by holding a 100% stock portfolio. Not only would this person not deplete their assets, but because the withdrawals are conservative, the value of their investments would grow over the long run in virtually any plausible future stock market. Hopefully it is clear that for this person, seeking the supposed safety of bonds would encumber the long-term growth of their portfolio and make depletion of their assets _more_ likely.

For the majority of Americans who are not multimillionaires, how can this principle be applied? If there is a portion of your savings you are reserving for the future and don’t plan to use for a number of years,<sup id="fn2">[2](#f2)</sup> on average you will benefit most by investing it in 100% stocks. (This does not imply that your stock allocation should be limited to long-term reserves.) For many people this description applies readily to a tax-advantaged retirement account. If you will not need to draw on your retirement funds in the next eight years, your retirement portfolio will have the strongest expected growth with 100% stocks. Any inclusion of bonds will attenuate its long-term value. For some this statement will seem obvious, but it is a widespread practice to include bonds in long-term retirement portfolios. The justification often does not seem to be that part of the money needs to be secure for potential premature access, but that the volatility of a 100% stock portfolio is emotionally uncomfortable.

&nbsp;

## Tax-advantaged accounts

Most tax-advantaged retirement accounts are either an [IRA](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/ira.asp) (individual retirement account) or an employer-sponsored [401(k)](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/1/401kplan.asp) account. They incentivize retirement planning by offering the opportunity to save a great deal on taxes if you set aside the money until old age. There are two ways to implement this, and an individual can use one or both. With a [traditional](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/traditionalira.asp) plan, no income tax is paid on contributions or investment earnings, but withdrawals are taxed as ordinary income. With a [Roth](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/rothira.asp) plan, contributions are taxed like the rest of your income, but earnings in the account and [appropriate withdrawals](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/q/qualifieddistribution.asp) are tax-free. Withdrawals are meant to be delayed until age 59½, so early withdrawals are hit with a 10% penalty on top of triggering any tax owed. You're exempt from penalty if you meet [uncommon criteria](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/q/qualifieddistribution.asp) or you're withdrawing only contributions (but not earnings) from a Roth account. The advantages of a traditional or Roth plan depend mainly on whether you expect your marginal tax rate during retirement to be higher or lower than the marginal tax rate in the year you’re contributing. A year with low income suggests the Roth plan.<sup id="fn3">[3](#f3)</sup> You should take advantage of employer matching every year in your IRA or 401(k) — even if you have high-interest debt. If there is a 50% matching policy, you will earn a risk-free, tax-deferred 50% return simply by contributing up to a certain limit. Even if you later need to withdraw the money prematurely with a 10% penalty, employer matching is not an opportunity you want to miss.

The only exception to this is if you plan to leave your company soon, and your matching contributions to a 401(k) [will not vest immediately](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/081815/can-my-company-ever-be-entitled-take-my-401k.asp). What does this mean? To incentivize retention, your employer may require a certain period of working years until your matching contributions belong to you completely. That is, until you are 100% vested, some or all of your matching contributions may be revoked if you leave. Vesting may increase by 20 percentage points each year, for example, but the schedule is up to the employer except for the legal requirement that it must reach 100% after six years. Once you are 100% vested after six years at most, all prior and future matching contributions are immediately and permanently assured regardless of when you leave the company. Once you have maxed out employer matching in a given year, you can continue tax-deductible contributions up to a limit, or contribute to another tax-advantaged account like a [health savings account (HSA)](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/hsa.asp) or [529 account](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/1/529plan.asp). These two additional account types provide tax advantages while allowing you to use the money for their designated purposes at any time — you don’t have to wait for old age.

#### Health savings accounts

HSAs are especially helpful: contributions are tax-deductible up to a limit, investments grow tax-free, and withdrawals used for qualifying medical expenses are not taxed. The account can pay for your own medical expenses as well as those of your spouse and dependents. You can reimburse yourself for previous medical expenses regardless of how long ago they were paid, as long as you can document the payments and the HSA was open when the expenses were incurred. Unlike your IRA or 401(k), your HSA even [escapes](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/09/18/this-triple-tax-advantaged-account-might-beat-your-401k-plan.html) FICA taxes, which fund Social Security and Medicare, as long as you contribute through your employer’s payroll deduction. For [most people](https://github.com/investindex/Taxes#the-essentials), FICA taxes amount to 7.65% of every dollar of income. Your employer may offer matching in your HSA because this enables them to pay you while escaping their share of FICA taxes too. HSAs do have a drawback: if you desperately need the money and withdraw it for non-medical reasons before age 65, you’ll pay a penalty of 20% — twice as high as in retirement accounts — in addition to income taxes. From a retirement perspective, you can use your HSA purely as an investment vehicle. After age 65, you can use it for medical expenses as you would have before, but the 20% penalty if you withdraw for other reasons will be gone. The withdrawals for non-medical reasons will be subject to tax, but so would withdrawals from a traditional IRA or 401(k).

If you commit to [an investment approach](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/personal-finance/091615/how-use-your-hsa-retirement.asp), you should max out HSA contributions every year and refrain from spending any of your HSA funds before 65, so that they appreciate maximally. You would pay for medical expenses before 65 with your checking account, not your HSA. This is a little counterintuitive, but it would allow your untaxed HSA contributions to spiral upward with tax-free capital gains, and much of the money would be withdrawn tax-free as well. As you age during retirement, you will probably spend [far more](https://www.soa.org/resources/research-reports/2013/research-health-care-birth-death/) on medical expenses than when you were younger, and maximizing your HSA would mean you’re able to fund those [large expenses](https://newsroom.fidelity.com/press-releases/news-details/2021/Fidelitys-20th-Annual-Retiree-Health-Care-Cost-Estimate-Hits-New-High-A-Couple-Retiring-Today-Will-Need-300000-to-Cover-Medical-Expenses-an-88-Increase-Since-2002/default.aspx) with invested money that has never been taxed.

Before 65 you cannot pay for insurance premiums with your HSA unless you're receiving unemployment benefits or using [COBRA](https://www.healthcare.gov/unemployed/cobra-coverage/), the federal program that allows you to keep your health insurance with a group plan after leaving a job by paying the full cost yourself. Once you turn 65, or enroll in Social Security or Medicare, you can no longer contribute to your HSA. But you can pay for most Medicare premiums with your HSA, as well as [long-term care insurance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ua7WMUSV1-A&ab_channel=RetirementRevealed) premiums. If the investment approach were initiated early in life, you would contribute several hundred thousand dollars and have millions of dollars in the account by age 65. It is best used along with retirement accounts, which allow further tax-advantaged contributions each year and provide a source of last-resort funds that can be withdrawn with a lower 10% penalty. However, if your need for cash becomes dire and you’ve saved documentation of your medical expenses, you can withdraw HSA funds tax-free with no penalty by [reimbursing yourself](https://www.hsaedge.com/2012/06/13/using-your-hsa-as-an-atm/) for past medical expenses, then use that money for whatever else. You could also use reimbursement as a means of tax-free withdrawal for normal expenses after 65, if your HSA funds exceed health needs.

#### 529 accounts, charity, and more

Contributions to a 529 account are not tax-deductible at the federal level, but some states provide deductions under certain conditions. They are still beneficial because investments grow tax-free and appropriate withdrawals used for education are not taxed. But you need to research the investment options available to you before contributing. An IRA or HSA can offer almost as much freedom as a standard brokerage account,<sup id="fn4">[4](#f4)</sup> but the options for your 401(k) or 529 may be less attractive. See the options you have for a [Vanguard 529 account](https://investor.vanguard.com/529-plan/list#/529-plan), for example. This is partly why [rolling over](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/ira-rollover.asp) your 401(k) into your IRA when you change employers is a good idea. You can also roll over while employed if your 401(k) provider allows "in-service" rollovers. You should consider carrying out a rollover at the first opportunity, because 401(k) providers [charge fees](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/personal-finance/061913/hidden-fees-401ks.asp) that will hamper your investment growth. These drawbacks of 401(k) investing imply that once you've maxed out 401(k) employer matching, you should prioritize your IRA and potentially your HSA. Only if you have reached the limit of tax-deductible contributions to these accounts, and you want to contribute even more, should you return to your 401(k). Contribution limits for 401(k) accounts are far higher than those for IRAs, which is a major benefit for people with high income. In 2022, IRA contributions are limited to $6,000 (or $7,000 for those who are at least 55), whereas the 401(k) limit is $20,500 (or $27,000 for those who are at least 50).

Finally, if charitable donations will be an important goal in your old age, traditional IRAs have a clear advantage over Roth IRAs. The untaxed contributions and investment earnings in your traditional IRA can be [donated tax-free](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/ira-charitable-rollover-provision-made-permanent-2015-12-25), whereas money in your Roth IRA has already been taxed and is ideally suited for personal spending. Your HSA is [poorly suited](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/what-are-the-rules-for-inheriting-an-hsa-2020-09-25) to charity as well as inheritance, so it's best used for personal spending after 65 if the amount exceeds anticipated health care spending. If you donate to charity using HSA funds, you still have to pay tax on those withdrawals. Your spouse can inherit your HSA with no tax paid — the funds are absorbed into their HSA — but any other beneficiary, including a charity, would have to pay tax on the full amount in the year of your death. Both traditional and Roth IRAs are better-suited to leave to children or others. None of these concerns should be a dominant influence on how much money you choose to spend or donate, but considering them will increase your wealth and the wealth of your beneficiaries.

For various examples of how judicious use of taxable, tax-deferred, and tax-exempt accounts during working and retirement years can enhance the longevity of your portfolio, see chapter 10 of Larry Swedroe's [book on retirement](https://libgen.is/search.php?req=Swedroe+Grogan+Your+Complete+Guide+to+a+Successful+and+Secure+Retirement&open=0&res=25&view=simple&phrase=1&column=def).

&nbsp;

## Summary

Don’t ignore the possibility of catastrophic loss — protect yourself. Consider paying debt before investing. Take pre-emptive action to prevent fraud and frequently check activity in your accounts. Money invested for the long term should be heavy on stocks. Use tax-advantaged accounts when you can, and consider exploiting the unique, under-appreciated advantages of HSAs. Max out employer matching even if you have debt, with awareness that if you change employers it is possible to lose some 401(k) matching due to your vesting schedule.

Footnotes:

<sup id="f1"> 1 </sup> To compare debt repayment to investing, we need to account for taxes that would be paid on the investment. Let's imagine that we're someone with a typical level of income for investors, so we're subject to a 24% marginal federal tax rate for ordinary income and a 15% federal tax rate for [long-term capital gains](https://github.com/investindex/Taxes). And let's say we live in a state that taxes both short- and long-term capital gains at 5%. So for short-term capital gains, we will be taxed at a rate of 29% (24% federal + 5% state), and for long-term capital gains, we will be taxed at a rate of 20% (15% federal + 5% state). We have two sources of debt: a student loan accruing interest at 5% [APY](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/apy.asp) and a home mortgage accruing interest at 3% APY. Payments on the 5% debt are equivalent to annualized short-term capital gains of .05/(1-.29) = 7.04%, and annualized long-term capital gains of .05/(1-.2) = 6.25%. Payments on the 3% debt are equivalent to annualized short-term capital gains of .03/(1-.29) = 4.23%, and annualized long-term capital gains of .03/(1-.2) = 3.75%. If we anticipate chiefly long-term capital gains from investing in stock funds, we can estimate that payments on the student loan are equivalent to a risk-free annualized return of 6.25%, and payments on the home mortgage are equivalent to a risk-free annualized return of 3.75%.

It would be sensible to recognize that the equivalent of a risk-free 6.25% annual return is a great deal, and to first pay off the student loan while making no more than minimum payments on the home mortgage. During this period we would not invest, or save large amounts of cash beyond an emergency fund. (The main exception would be contributing to tax-advantaged accounts with employer matching, as discussed in [this section](https://github.com/investindex/Guidelines#tax-advantaged-accounts).) After completely paying off the student loan, we could begin allocating money to a stock portfolio. Our expected return from the stock portfolio might be 8-10% annually before taxes, which is about 6.4-8.0% after taxes. This is significantly higher than the risk-free 3% gains from making extra payments on the home mortgage. A stock portfolio also has the benefit of liquidity, while the cash value of home equity is hard to access if it's needed. The amount of the student loan or the mortgage is not relevant to these considerations, although some people irrationally might want to [pay off smaller debts first](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNmFrw0kdfM&ab_channel=PreetBanerjee). Ben Felix explains in [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKc01jo1qLw&ab_channel=BenFelix) why it often makes sense to pay off your mortgage instead of allocating a large fraction of your taxable portfolio to bonds. After paying off the mortgage, we could begin increasing the allocation to bonds in the taxable portfolio, so that it fits whatever level of risk we find appropriate. [↩](#fn1)

<sup id="f2"> 2 </sup> How many years exactly? A weasel word, _number_, is used because there is no perfect answer. The historical evidence suggests that a five-year horizon is sufficient in a large majority of cases, while an eight-year horizon is very safe and will permit you to wait for a recovery from nearly any potential downturn. In US history, only the [Great Depression](https://github.com/investindex/Risk#f5) would violate this rule. [↩](#fn2)

<sup id="f3"> 3 </sup> Someone with a large traditional IRA could also [convert some money to their Roth IRA](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/iraconversion.asp) by paying taxes that year on the transferred money. If you have a six-figure income, you may exceed IRS limits for contributing to a Roth IRA, but you can still do so [through a backdoor](https://www.investopedia.com/how-to-set-up-a-backdoor-roth-ira-4584775).

<sup id="f4"> 4 </sup> Money in tax-advantaged accounts cannot legally be traded on [margin](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/margin.asp), so IRAs and HSAs are still less capable than a taxable brokerage account. A feature called limited margin is allowed, which allows you to re-use funds immediately instead of being subject to a two-day [settlement period](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/settlement_period.asp), as is required in a cash account. By design, limited margin does not permit use of borrowed funds. [↩](#fn4)
