# Guidelines for financial planning

There is no perfect distribution of stocks, long-term bonds, short-term bonds, cash, and other assets. This depends on many factors. Health, age, debt, income, job security, marriage status, children (or plans to have them), risk tolerance, and your personal goals — these are only some of them. The broad goal here is to provide tools to assess what investments fit your situation. However, a few guidelines can be applied broadly, and exploring them will help consider how to personalize your own finances. Some mathematical details of retirement planning are also described.

&nbsp;

## Minimize risk of catastrophic loss

First, avoid extreme investment risks. Investing can be most hazardous when using debt or [leverage](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/leverage.asp): using [margin](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/margin.asp) features in a brokerage account or loans to invest in real estate, for instance. Leverage is not always dangerous, but it puts you at greater risk of large losses. It even creates the possibility of losing more than you invested, replacing what was once an asset with unexpected debt. Although I wouldn’t discourage all uses of leverage — a home mortgage is a form of leverage — none of the investment options recommended here use it.

Second, _always_ have insurance for extremely valuable physical assets like your car and home, as well as health insurance. Even if your car has low value, liability coverage is vital for car insurance. Without it, you could find yourself paying the medical bills of someone you injured in a car accident. Understand the coverage you’re entitled to, so that you’re not subject to surprise denials. Once you’ve achieved some financial stability, seriously consider purchasing disability insurance. Almost everyone's most valuable asset is not something that comprises their current wealth — it is their capacity to earn income. Social Security disability payments are probably not enough to support you if you’re unable to continue earning income. You may be able to purchase disability insurance through your employer; this can be less expensive but it may not be tailored to your needs and usually lacks portability if you change employers. If anyone else depends on your future income, purchasing life insurance is a way to safeguard them. The most suitable type for nearly everyone is [term life insurance](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/termlife.asp) (instead of [whole life insurance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AgBhy8iXjpI&ab_channel=TwoCents) or [universal life insurance](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/205.asp)). Finally, your most basic financial priority should be to build or maintain an [emergency fund](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vftjBTjFlzI&ab_channel=TwoCents) after paying off credit card debt.

Many people don’t take these actions or, if their finances are chronically strained, are unable to. But be aware that if you neglect to protect yourself, there will be an ever-present risk of financial ruin. Insurance may seem like a waste of money when times are good, but never forget that unpredictable, unavoidable events can shatter your life in an instant. Nothing can bankrupt you faster than expensive tragedies like a health crisis without health insurance.

&nbsp;

## Simplify, don't oversimplify

Index funds are useful because they invest in a shifting collection of hundreds or thousands of securities, which would be an onerous task for anyone without access to institutional resources. They illustrate that simple solutions can be superior to complex solutions. There are expanding offerings for the ultimate simplification: [all-in-one](https://investor.vanguard.com/mutual-funds/lifestrategy) [funds](https://www.schwab.com/mutual-funds/mutual-fund-portfolio/market-track-portfolios). They allow you to select a single fund based on allocation, such as 60% stocks and 40% bonds, and provide you with an automatically [rebalanced](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/rebalancing.asp), globally diversified assembly of stocks and bonds. Although using one of these is far better than not investing, they carry a hazard.

When you decide how much money to save and invest, you should consider why you are investing: retirement, college tuition, a vacation, a down payment on a car or house. Assigning purposes to various portions of your money forces you to consider which investments are appropriate for each portion. One-decision funds, on the other hand, may cause someone to vaguely reflect on the level of risk they desire, without ever thinking through how they would distribute each portion to specific buckets like stocks, long-term bonds, and short-term bonds. Whatever degree of complexity you choose, ensure that your allocation is the result of deliberate planning.

&nbsp;

## Debt and investment

Pay debt instead of holding bonds or cash, and pay high-interest debt instead of holding stocks. Someone with low-interest loans — let’s say less than 4% [APY](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/apy.asp) — should not invest in bonds or hold large amounts of cash. This [usually includes someone](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKc01jo1qLw&ab_channel=BenFelix) with a home mortgage. Someone paying high interest — a 7% student loan or a 16% credit card loan — should not invest in the stock market either. A tax-free and risk-free 7% annualized return is achieved by every payment on a 7% APY loan. This is preferable to the higher average return from stocks, because the latter carries far more risk and will be taxed. Of course, you should address debt with the highest interest rate first; for many people this is credit card debt. All super high-interest loans like these should be paid off before investing or even building savings. Someone with a 4-5% APY loan should prioritize paying it, although they may want to hold some stocks as well. These groupings are somewhat arbitrary, but the underlying principle is that you should aim for the highest [risk-adjusted](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/riskadjustedreturn.asp) return after taxes.

&nbsp;

## Allocation and time horizon

People with higher net worth relative to their financial needs have longer time horizons, and benefit from allocating more heavily to stocks. This can be illustrated with an extreme case. A person with $4 million in liquid net worth could withdraw [about 2.5% each year](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BScK-QyWIo&ab_channel=BenFelix) — $100,000 in the first year before taxes — and live on these withdrawals indefinitely by holding a 100% stock portfolio. Not only would this person not deplete their assets, but because the withdrawals are conservative, the value of their investments would grow over the long run in virtually any plausible future stock market. Hopefully it is clear that for this person, seeking the supposed safety of bonds would encumber the long-term growth of their portfolio and make depletion of their assets _more_ likely.

For the majority of Americans who are not multimillionaires, how can this principle be applied? If there is a portion of your savings you are reserving for the future and don’t plan to use for a number of years,<sup id="fn1">[1](#f1)</sup> on average you will benefit most by investing it in 100% stocks. (This does not imply that your stock allocation should be limited to long-term reserves.) For many people this description applies readily to a tax-advantaged retirement account. If you will not need to draw on your retirement funds in the next eight years, your retirement portfolio will have the strongest expected growth with 100% stocks. Any inclusion of bonds will attenuate its long-term value. For some this statement will seem obvious, but it is a widespread practice to include bonds in long-term retirement portfolios. The justification often does not seem to be that part of the money needs to be secure for potential premature access, but that the volatility of a 100% stock portfolio is emotionally uncomfortable.

&nbsp;

## Tax-advantaged accounts

Most tax-advantaged retirement accounts are either an [IRA](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/ira.asp) (individual retirement account) or an employer-sponsored [401(k)](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/1/401kplan.asp). They incentivize retirement planning by offering the opportunity to save a great deal on taxes if you set aside the money until old age. There are two ways to implement this, and an individual can use one or both. With a traditional plan, no income tax is paid on contributions or earnings from investment, but withdrawals are taxed as ordinary income. With a Roth plan, contributions are taxed like the rest of your income, but earnings and [appropriate withdrawals](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/q/qualifieddistribution.asp) are tax-free.<sup id="fn2">[2](#f2)</sup> Withdrawals are meant to be delayed until age 59½, so early withdrawals are hit with a 10% penalty on top of triggering any tax owed, unless you meet [uncommon criteria](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/q/qualifieddistribution.asp). You should take advantage of employer matching every year in your IRA or 401(k) — even if you have high-interest debt. If there is a 50% matching policy, you will earn a risk-free, tax-deferred 50% return simply by contributing up to a certain limit. Even if you later need to withdraw the money prematurely with a 10% penalty, employer matching is not an opportunity you want to miss.

The only exception to this is if you plan to leave your company soon, and your matching contributions to a 401(k) [will not vest immediately](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/081815/can-my-company-ever-be-entitled-take-my-401k.asp). What does this mean? To incentize retention, your employer may require a certain period of working years until your matching contributions belong to you completely. That is, until you are 100% vested, some or all of your matching contributions may be revoked if you leave. Vesting may increase by 20 percentage points each year, for example, but the schedule is up to the employer except for the legal requirement that it must reach 100% after six years. Once you are 100% vested after six years at most, all prior and future matching contributions are immediately and permanently assured regardless of when you leave the company. Once you have maxed out employer matching in a given year, you can keep contributing up to a limit, or contribute to another tax-advantaged account like a [health savings account (HSA)](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/hsa.asp) or [529 account](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/1/529plan.asp).

These two additional account types provide tax advantages while allowing you to use the money for their designated purposes at any time — you don’t have to wait for old age. HSAs are especially helpful: contributions are tax-deductible up to a limit, investments grow tax-free, and withdrawals used for qualifying medical expenses are not taxed. You can reimburse yourself for previous medical expenses regardless of how long ago they were paid, as long as you can document the payments and the HSA was open when the expenses were incurred. Unlike your IRA or 401(k), your HSA even [escapes](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/09/18/this-triple-tax-advantaged-account-might-beat-your-401k-plan.html) FICA taxes, which fund Social Security and Medicare, as long as you contribute through your employer’s payroll deduction. For most people, FICA taxes amount to 7.65% of every dollar of income. Your employer may offer matching in your HSA because this enables them to pay you while escaping their share of FICA taxes too. HSAs do have a drawback: if you desperately need the money and withdraw it for non-medical reasons before age 65, you’ll pay a penalty of 20% — twice as high as in retirement accounts — in addition to income taxes. From a retirement perspective, you can use your HSA purely as an investment vehicle. After age 65, you can use it for medical expenses as you would have before, but the 20% penalty if you withdraw for other reasons will be gone. The withdrawals for non-medical reasons will be subject to tax, but so would withdrawals from a traditional IRA or 401(k).

If you commit to [an investment approach](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/personal-finance/091615/how-use-your-hsa-retirement.asp), you should max out HSA contributions every year and refrain from spending any of your HSA funds before 65, so that they appreciate maximally. You would pay for medical expenses before 65 with your checking account, not your HSA. This is a little counterintuitive, but it would allow your untaxed HSA contributions to spiral upward with tax-free capital gains, and much of the money would be withdrawn tax-free as well. As you age during retirement, you will probably spend [far more](https://www.soa.org/resources/research-reports/2013/research-health-care-birth-death/) on medical expenses than when you were younger, and maximizing your HSA would mean you’re able to fund those [large expenses](https://newsroom.fidelity.com/press-releases/news-details/2021/Fidelitys-20th-Annual-Retiree-Health-Care-Cost-Estimate-Hits-New-High-A-Couple-Retiring-Today-Will-Need-300000-to-Cover-Medical-Expenses-an-88-Increase-Since-2002/default.aspx) with invested money that has never been taxed. Once you turn 65, you can no longer contribute to your HSA. If the investment approach were initiated early in life, you would contribute several hundred thousand dollars and have millions of dollars in the account by age 65. It is best used along with retirement accounts, which allow further tax-advantaged contributions each year and provide a source of last-resort funds that can be withdrawn with a lower 10% penalty. However, if your need for cash becomes dire and you’ve saved documentation of your medical expenses, you can withdraw HSA funds tax-free with no penalty by reimbursing yourself for past medical expenses, then use that money for whatever else. You could also use reimbursement as a means of tax-free withdrawal for normal expenses after 65, if your HSA funds exceed health needs.

Contributions to a 529 account are not tax-deductible at the federal level, but some states provide deductions under certain conditions. They are still beneficial because investments grow tax-free and appropriate withdrawals used for education are not taxed. But you need to research the investment options available to you before contributing. An IRA or HSA can offer almost as much freedom as a standard brokerage account,<sup id="fn3">[3](#f3)</sup> but the options for your 401(k) or 529 may be less attractive. This is partly why [rolling over](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/ira-rollover.asp) your 401(k) into your IRA when you change employers is a good idea. You can also roll over while employed if your 401(k) provider allows "in-service" rollovers. You should carry out a rollover at the first opportunity, because 401(k) providers [charge fees](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/personal-finance/061913/hidden-fees-401ks.asp) that will hamper your investment growth.

Finally, if charitable donations will be an important goal in your old age, traditional IRAs have a clear advantage over Roth IRAs. The untaxed contributions and investment earnings in your traditional IRA can be [donated tax-free](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/ira-charitable-rollover-provision-made-permanent-2015-12-25), whereas money in your Roth IRA has already been taxed and is ideally suited for personal spending. However, your HSA should be an even higher priority in old age for charity, not because of its direct suitability but because it is [much less suited](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/what-are-the-rules-for-inheriting-an-hsa-2020-09-25) than a traditional IRA for inheritance by anyone except your spouse. That is, any non-spousal beneficiary would pay far more tax on inherited money from an HSA than from a traditional IRA. A charity or your spouse can inherit the funds in your HSA tax-free upon your death.

&nbsp;

## Summary

Don’t ignore the possibility of catastrophic loss — protect yourself. Consider paying debt before investing. Money invested for the long term should be heavy on stocks. Use tax-advantaged accounts when you can, and consider exploiting the unique, under-appreciated advantages of HSAs. Max out employer matching even if you have debt, with awareness that if you change employers it is possible to lose some 401(k) matching due to your vesting schedule.

## Retirement math

While the [previous section](https://github.com/investindex/Risk#preparing-for-the-long-run) provided a broad overview of retirement planning, a few specific methods of calculation are worth reviewing here. First, a simple matter of computing average return. If over three years our investments provide annual returns of 7%, 15.5%, and -2%, what is the average annual return? We must convert these percentage changes to multipliers: 1.07, 1.155, and .98. The geometric mean is calculated as (1.07×1.155×.98)^(1/3) = 1.0659, a 6.59% average annual return. See this footnote for why it must be calculated that way.<sup id="fn4">[4](#f4)</sup>

Second, how does inflation work when calculating returns? We can calculate growth over time based on an anticipated average rate of return. If we assume a 9% average annual return over 40 years, the asset will be multiplied by 1.09^40 = 31.4. This is our nominal return, which is distinguished from the real return — that which remains after accounting for inflation. It is calculated as 1.09/1.025 = 1.0634, or a 6.34% real return. This gives us a real multiplier over 40 years of (1.09/1.025)^40 = 11.7. So instead of imagining that your money will multiply by 31.4, remember that your dollars will be worth less in 40 years, and the multiplier will feel much more like 11.7. If this shrinking multiplier is discouraging, imagine how your assets would decay if you didn't invest at all: (1/1.025)^40 = .372. They would lose 63% of their value over 40 years! A 9% nominal return converts that multiplier of .37 to 11.7.

Finally, how can we find the savings needed to spend a given amount during retirement, while accounting for inflation and investment earnings? Let's imagine that we want an annual "income" of $60,000 in today's dollars by drawing from our investments and receiving Social Security payments. Keep in mind that this is for an individual — a married couple would need to spend more, but probably not twice as much. We've used the government's [calculator](https://www.ssa.gov/benefits/retirement/estimator.html) and estimated that our middle-class income will entitle us to about $15K per year from Social Security. We'll rely on our investments for the remaining $45K. These amounts are expressed in today's dollars, because that's what we can relate to — $161K of inflated dollars 40 years in the future is not intuitive. We decide that we'll commit to withdrawing an average of 3% of the nest egg per year, reducing withdrawals slightly when our investments drop in value and potentially increasing them when our investments perform very well. An average 3% withdrawal of $45K translates to a nest egg of 45,000×(100/3) = 1,500,000. Assuming 2.5% average inflation for 40 years, $1.5M in today's dollars would be multiplied by 1.025^40 to give $4.03M. That's the actual dollar amount we're aiming for in 40 years to provide a standard of living similar to $60K/year today. How can we reach it?

There are many ways of doing so. We'll describe the simplest first. We save and invest $8,361 the first year, and every year we increase that amount by our anticipated average inflation rate, 2.5%. So in the second year we save $8,571, and so on until we save $22,451 in the 40th year (8,361.47×1.025^40 = 22,451). If our nominal returns are 9% as expected, then we'll have saved $563,584 and built a nest egg of $4.03M by the end of the 40th year. We can use this method to illustrate how important it is to start early. Our first year savings target is $8,361 if we have a 40-year horizon, but with 30 years the figure is $16,797; with 20 years it is $36,959; and with 10 years it is $105,312. When you start late, you give your capital less time to appreciate. See this footnote for how to calculate the first year's target.<sup id="fn5">[5](#f5)</sup>

A variation on this approach is to increase savings each year by last year's inflation, rather than an assumed long-term average inflation rate like 2.5%. This is a good idea, but of course when planning you will find yourself doing the same calculations because you cannot know what each year's inflation will be. If a given year has unusually low inflation, you may want to adhere to your assumed long-term rate anyway, to be safe.

This first approach could be called time-invariant or flat: you contribute the same inflation-adjusted amount every year. This is advantageous because the more you frontload your retirement savings, the less you have to save overall. In the example above, we contributed only 14% of the final nest egg and investment took care of the rest. In other words, more than six out of every seven dollars were the fruits of investing! If you could put away even more in your early life than this approach would suggest, that would be great. But some people need to do the opposite: they cannot save much until later in life. So we could design an approach in which we increase savings each year in addition to inflation, to acknowledge the growth in ability to save.

Imagine the same conditions as described above, but we increase savings each year by 2% on top of 2.5% for inflation. Our target savings in the first year will be only $6,453, a 23% reduction from the flat approach above. In the second year we save $6,453×1.02×1.025 = $6,747. In the 40th year we need to save $38,259, a 70% increase compared to the first example. Investment still does most of the work for us: we save only 17% of the $4.03M. But it turns out to be a lot more in absolute terms: we had to put away $699,023 using this approach, an increase of over $135,000 or about 24%. We worked harder to build the same wealth in this example, but it is a more realistic model for many people. An interesting twist for people who can frontload their savings would be to _decrease_ inflation-adjusted savings each year. For example, someone who frontloads with decreases of 2.5% each year as well as 2.5% increases for inflation would need to save $11,003 their first year and only $10,731 in their 40th year! (Calculated as 11,002.89(.975×1.025)^40.) The total savings needed to reach the $4.03M goal would be only $434,794. See this footnote for how to calculate the first year's amount for the growth approach.<sup id="fn6">[6](#f6)</sup>

You may find it useful to reverse these equations and convert certain savings patterns into retirement income. This footnote describes how to do it.<sup id="fn7">[7](#f7)</sup>

The assumptions of the examples above are open to question: someone might object that a 3% average withdrawal rate is overly conservative, or that 2.5% anticipated inflation is not conservative enough. Indeed, you should calculate what your retirement plan looks like in a future with poor performance. Imagine 7% nominal stock market returns and 3.5% inflation, yielding a real annual return of 3.38% (1.07/1.035 = 1.0338). The 40-year real multiplier drops from 11.7 in our example above to only 3.8. This is a very pessimistic projection, but it is important to test the limits of your retirement planning with unlikely yet possible futures like these. A 3% withdrawal rate is indeed conservative and, as long as you allocate mostly to stocks, will mean that your assets are likely to grow over time despite withdrawals. Reducing withdrawals when stocks have fallen enhances the longevity of your assets.

<sup id="f1"> 1 </sup> How many years exactly? A weasel word, _number_, is used because there is no perfect answer. The historical evidence suggests that a five-year horizon is sufficient in a large majority of cases, while an eight-year horizon is very safe and will permit you to wait for a recovery from nearly any potential downturn. In US history, only the Great Depression would violate this rule. [↩](#fn1)

<sup id="f2"> 2 </sup> The potential advantages of a traditional or Roth plan depend mainly on whether you expect your average tax rate to be higher during retirement or the year in which you’re contributing. A year with unusually low income suggests preferring the Roth plan, but someone with a large traditional IRA could also [convert some money to their Roth IRA](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/iraconversion.asp) by paying taxes that year on the transferred money. If you have a six-figure income, you may exceed IRS limits for contributing to a Roth IRA, but you can still do so [through a backdoor](https://www.investopedia.com/how-to-set-up-a-backdoor-roth-ira-4584775). [↩](#fn2)

<sup id="f3"> 3 </sup> Money in tax-advantaged accounts cannot legally be traded on [margin](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/margin.asp), so IRAs and HSAs are still less capable than a taxable brokerage account. A feature called limited margin is allowed, which allows you to re-use funds immediately instead of being subject to a two-day [settlement period](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/settlement_period.asp), as is required in a cash account. By design, limited margin does not permit [leverage](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/leverage.asp). [↩](#fn3)

<sup id="f4"> 4 </sup> For some people it may not be obvious why the more common arithmetic mean is unsuitable. Perhaps we could have found the average return like this: (7+15.5-2)/3 = 6.83 or (1.07+1.155+.98)/3 = 1.0683. To consider this, we can imagine an unlikely sequence of returns, in which we double our money the first year and halve it the following year. Multiplying an asset by 2 and then .5 returns it to its original value. We can calculate the geometric mean of these multipliers, which we know intuitively should be 1: (2×.5)^(1/2) = 1. That's right, but the arithmetic mean gives us an incorrect answer, (2+.5)/2 = 1.25. Another way of checking this is finding that the average return matches the actual return. 1.07×1.155×.98 = 1.21, which equals 1.0659^3. The arithmetic mean of 1.0683 does not satisfy this test. Because we are averaging multiplicative factors, the geometric mean must be applied. [↩](#fn4)

There are five variables: R for nominal average return, B for average inflation, T for time horizon, D for desired retirement income in today's dollars, and W for withdrawal rate.

How is this equation derived? I think the most intuitive way of understanding it is to consider the original value of each year's savings, and the expected growth by the end of the 40-year period. The nominal average return is R and the average inflation is B. We'll call the original value of the first year's savings S (it was $8,571 in the example above). After 40 years, the first year's deposit has simply grown at 9% annually, so its value is S×R^40. The second year's deposit is larger by a factor of B, but has only 39 years to appreciate. At the end of the period its value is S×B×R^39. The third deposit is multiplied by B again and has only 38 years to appreciate, so its value at the end of the period is S×B^2×R^38. We can now see a pattern, in which the exponents of B and R sum to 40. So the total value of the nest egg at the end of the period is N = S(R^40 + B×R^39 + B^2×R^38 + ... + B^38×R^2 + B^39×R). Let's call everything in the parentheses Z to simplify. So N = S×Z and S = N/Z. But we did some work to find N above, which was $4.03M in our example, and we can distill its parts. It's derived from the desired retirement income in today's dollars (D), the withdrawal rate (W), the average inflation (B), and the time horizon. Instead of always using 40 years, we'll also make the time horizon a variable T. D(100/W) gives us the nest egg in today's dollars, and B^T is the inflation factor over the full period: N = D(100/W)×B^T. So finally we've isolated S, the target savings in our first year, in terms we can mostly understand: S = N/Z = D(100/W)×B^T / Z.

The nasty part of this equation is Z. It can be tamed by reframing its parts. The first term is easy: R^40. The second term is B×R^39, but it _could_ be expressed as R^40×(B/R). This may seem pointless, but we can define the third term as R^40×(B/R)^2, and the fourth term as R^40×(B/R)^3. Now instead of separate exponents that sum to T=40, we have a single exponent that increases from 0 to 39, or more generally 0 to T-1. Z can be understood as R^T multiplied by the sum of (B/R)^Y from Y=0 to Y=T-1. The equation is now well-defined enough to implement, as it was in the [WolframAlpha calculator](https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=ReplaceAll%5BD*%28100%2FW%29*B%5ET+%2F+%28R%5ET+*+Sum%5B%28B%2FR%29%5EY%2C+%7BY%2C+0%2C+T-1%7D%5D%29%2C+%7BR+-%3E+1.09%2C+B+-%3E+1.025%2C+T+-%3E+40%2C+D+-%3E+45000%2C+W+-%3E+3%7D%5D).

An additional variable, G, denotes the target growth in savings beyond inflation. When deriving this modified equation, the only affected part was the notorious Z (see footnote 5). Since every term after the first needs to be multiplied by G, (B/R)^Y is changed to (G×B/R)^Y. The numerator is the same because the final nest egg amount does not change. Setting G equal to 1 makes the formula identical to the first. [↩](#fn6)

If a flat approach is desired, set G equal to 1 to effectively remove it. Deriving this equation is straightforward. From footnote 5, S is the first year's savings and S = D(100/W)×B^T / Z, therefore D = S×Z / (100/W×B^T). [↩](#fn7)

The WolframAlpha formula for the flat approach is:

ReplaceAll[D\*(100/W)\*B^T / (R^T \* Sum[(B/R)^Y, {Y, 0, T-1}]), {R -> 1.09, B -> 1.025, T -> 40, D -> 45000, W -> 3}]

And for the growth approach:

ReplaceAll[D\*(100/W)\*B^T / (R^T \* Sum[(G*B/R)^Y, {Y, 0, T-1}]), {G -> 1.02, R -> 1.09, B -> 1.025, T -> 40, D -> 45000, W -> 3}]

And to calculate retirement income from savings:

ReplaceAll[S \* R^T \* Sum[(G\*B/R)^Y, {Y, 0, T-1}] / ((100/W)\*B^T), {S -> 6453.1, G -> 1.02, R -> 1.09, B -> 1.025, T -> 40, W -> 3}]
